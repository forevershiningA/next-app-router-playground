Here’s a focused, programmatic-SEO audit of the exact page you shared, with concrete fixes you can roll out across the whole template (so every similar design page benefits).

# What I can see right now

* The page resolves with the title “Biblical Memorial – Traditional Engraved Headstone | Forever Shining | DYO Headstones.” That’s good branding but long. ([forevershining.org][1])
* Initial HTML looks JS-heavy (I briefly see a “Loading memorial designs…” style message), which hints that most content may only render client-side. That’s risky for crawl/index reliability on deep design URLs. ([forevershining.org][1])

# High-impact fixes (template-level)

## 1) Pre-render the page content (SSG/SSR + hydration)

**Problem:** If the H1, copy, price, images, and schema are client-only, Google may index thin HTML or miss content on some crawls.
**Fix:** Use Next.js SSG/ISR to output fully rendered HTML for each design URL (plus structured data) and hydrate on the client. Keep the 3D/interactive bits lazy-loaded.
**Add:** A minimal server-rendered description, feature list, and a static hero image in the initial HTML so your LCP is meaningful.

## 2) Shorten & standardize the slug

**Problem:** Current slug is very long and brittle for sharing/duplication.
**Fix:** Programmatically generate compact slugs with a stable design ID:

```
/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial/curved-top-john-3-16-d1234
```

Add a **self-canonical** to the preferred short slug, and 301 any legacy long slugs to it.

## 3) Tight, keyword-rich metadata (60/160 rule)

**Title (≤60 chars):**
“Curved-Top Biblical Headstone – John 3:16 | Forever Shining”

**Meta description (≤160):**
“Curved-top traditional engraved headstone with John 3:16. Choose material, size, inscription & motifs. View price instantly or design online.”

Roll these fields from your product DB (shape, verse, material, DYO).

## 4) Rich, unique body content block (auto-generated)

Add a **300–600 word** server-rendered section per page, with tokens you can fill from your catalog:

* What this design includes (shape, sizes, materials, finish)
* The verse context (1–2 lines about John 3:16)
* Engraving options (fonts, layout constraints)
* Lead time & cemetery compliance
* Link to DYO (“Open in designer with this preset”)
  This offsets template duplication across thousands of designs.

## 5) Image & media SEO

* **LCP image:** server-rendered `<img>`/`next/image` with explicit `width/height` and `fetchpriority="high"` on the primary hero.
* **Alt text (programmatic):** “Curved-top biblical headstone with John 3:16, polished black granite, 610×460 mm.”
* **File names:** `biblical-curved-top-john-3-16-black-granite.jpg`
* **Lazy-load** secondary gallery images; preload only the hero.

## 6) Internal linking modules (auto-filled)

Add 2 modules near the bottom:

* **Related designs:** 6–8 links (same shape or verse family).
* **Popular categories:** Traditional, Laser-Etched, Bronze Plaques, etc., linking back to collection pages.
  This pushes crawl paths and distributes PageRank from collection pages (your “Select Product” flow already provides good category semantics). ([forevershining.org][2])

## 7) Structured data (JSON-LD) — programmatic

Include at least these, server-rendered:

### BreadcrumbList

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Designs","item":"https://forevershining.org/designs"},
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Traditional Headstone","item":"https://forevershining.org/designs/traditional-headstone"},
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"Biblical Memorial","item":"https://forevershining.org/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial"},
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"name":"Curved-Top – John 3:16","item":"https://forevershining.org/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial/curved-top-john-3-16"}
  ]
}
```

### Product (or `CreativeWork` if not strictly retail)

```json
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"Product",
  "name":"Curved-Top Biblical Headstone – John 3:16",
  "sku":"D1234",
  "brand":{"@type":"Brand","name":"Forever Shining"},
  "category":"Memorial > Traditional Engraved Headstone",
  "image":[
    "https://forevershining.org/images/biblical-curved-top-john-3-16-black-granite.jpg"
  ],
  "description":"Traditional curved-top engraved headstone featuring John 3:16. Materials: black granite, grey granite. Sizes: 610×460 mm, 760×610 mm. Custom fonts and motifs available.",
  "offers":{
    "@type":"Offer",
    "availability":"https://schema.org/InStock",
    "priceCurrency":"AUD",
    "price":"POA",
    "url":"https://forevershining.org/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial/curved-top-john-3-16"
  }
}
```

### FAQPage (3–5 Q&As you can auto-fill)

```json
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"FAQPage",
  "mainEntity":[
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I change the verse or font?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, edit any inscription, font and layout in the Design-Your-Own tool or ask our designers to help for free."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"What sizes and materials are available?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Common sizes include 610×460 mm and 760×610 mm in black or grey granite. Custom sizes on request."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"How long is production and delivery?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Typical lead time is X–Y weeks after design approval and cemetery permit. We ship Australia-wide."}}
  ]
}
```

(If you don’t want `Product`, use `CreativeWork` + `isPartOf` to the collection.)

## 8) Canonicals, hreflang, and param hygiene

* **Canonical:** self-canonical to the short slug.
* **Hreflang:** if you target AU/US/UK, emit `en-AU`, `en-US`, `en-GB` alternates (and self) from a language map.
* **UTM/filters:** force canonicalization; append `?utm_*` should not create indexable variants.

## 9) Page speed (LCP/INP) at scale

* **Preload** the hero image and primary font (latin subset only).
* **Split code** so the DYO/3D designer loads only after interaction.
* **Defer** non-critical CSS, and inline a small critical CSS block for above-the-fold layout.
* **INP guardrails:** throttle heavy listeners from design widgets until user clicks “Open Designer.”

## 10) Collection & sitemap scaffolding

* Ensure category pages (e.g., “Traditional Headstone” and “Biblical Memorial”) list these items with **crawlable links** (not JS-only). Include pagination with rel-like link tags and crawlable URLs.
* Generate an **XML sitemap** for design detail pages, another for collections, and a third for images (hero images only).

## 11) E-E-A-T & trust blocks (auto-insert)

* “Made in Australia,” compliance, warranties, council approvals, and real photos of installs (with city/region).
* Company schema (`Organization`), NAP in footer, About and Contact pages linked sitewide.

## 12) Social cards

Set OG/Twitter for rich sharing (programmatic):

* `og:title`: “Curved-Top Biblical Headstone – John 3:16 | Forever Shining”
* `og:description`: 1–2 lines from the meta description
* `og:image`: the hero at 1200×630
* `twitter:card`: summary_large_image

# Quick wins specific to *this* URL

1. **Trim the slug** and add a self-canonical to the shorter version.
2. **Server-render** the H1, copy, price/CTA, and schema so they’re visible without JS. (Right now I only catch a loader before content renders.) ([forevershining.org][1])
3. **Add a 300–600 word unique description** (programmatic tokens) and a bulleted spec list.
4. **Emit Product + BreadcrumbList + FAQPage** JSON-LD with live values.
5. **Hero image optimization:** make it the LCP, preloaded with correct `width/height` and `fetchpriority`.
6. **Related links:** “More Biblical memorials,” “Other curved-top headstones,” and “Popular verses” (John 3:16, Psalm 23, etc.), all hard links.
7. **Open Designer deep-link:** “Customize this exact design” (URL param or ID) so Google sees a clear CTA and users jump straight into DYO.

# Optional (but valuable) programmatic layers

* **Verse-aware enrichment:** auto-generate a tasteful, 1–2 sentence neutral context for the verse (no doctrine, just context + design relevance).
* **Region tokens:** if location is known (e.g., WA), add one localized sentence about install/permit coverage.
* **Image captions:** short, human-readable captions under images (also improve accessibility).
* **Review/Ratings:** if genuine, aggregate by design family (not per-SKU) to avoid sparse data.
