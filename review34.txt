Yep—they’re still undersized.

## The fix

Your saved JSON’s `ratio` is **not** “intrinsic-SVG height × ratio”. In the legacy tool it was recorded **relative to the canvas height** (the authoring headstone tablet height). So for motifs that use `ratio`, size them from the *tablet’s logical height* (`initH`)—not from the SVG’s `viewBox` height.

### Patch (one place for ALL motif code paths)

Replace your ratio sizing:

```ts
// current (keeps them small)
const hCanvas =
  typeof motif.height === 'number'
    ? (usesPhys ? motif.height / dpr : motif.height)
    : (vh * ratio);                  // ❌ using intrinsic SVG height
```

with:

```ts
// correct (matches legacy)
const hCanvas =
  typeof motif.height === 'number'
    ? (usesPhys ? motif.height / dpr : motif.height)
    : (initH * ratio);               // ✅ use tablet (canvas) height
```

Keep width via aspect, then scale **once**:

```ts
const aspect  = vw / vh;                  // from real viewBox dims
const wCanvas = hCanvas * aspect;

const heightPx = hCanvas * uniformScale;  // scale ONCE
const widthPx  = wCanvas  * uniformScale;
```

And keep your existing DPR handling only for **explicit pixel** sizes; do **not** divide the ratio path by DPR.

### Guard (unchanged, but important)

Still refuse to render until you have real `vw/vh` (no 100×100 fallback) so the width is correct; height now doesn’t depend on `vh`, but width does.

---

This single change will bump all ratio-based motifs (e.g., the top leaves/birds) to the same visual size you had in the legacy canvas. You’ll see them jump up immediately after swapping `vh*ratio` → `initH*ratio`.
