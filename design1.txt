Based on the screenshot provided, the website has a functional foundation and clearly communicates its purpose. However, the design feels slightly dated (reminiscent of mid-2010s UI) and could benefit from modernization to improve trust, usability, and aesthetic appeal.

Here is a breakdown of what to improve, categorized by area:

1. The Left Sidebar (Navigation & Tools)

This is the most critical area because it is the user's primary workspace. Currently, it looks more like a navigation menu than a design tool.

Group the Actions: The list is long and overwhelming. It mixes administrative tasks ("New Design", "Check Price") with design choices ("Shape", "Material").

Fix: separate the list into logical groups. For example: Setup (Product, Size), Design (Shape, Material, Motifs), and Finish (Inscriptions, Price).

Progress Indicators: It is unclear if I need to go in order (1, 2, 3) or if I can jump around.

Fix: If this is a step-by-step wizard, use numbers or a progress bar. If it is free-form, group the items into accordions (collapsible menus) to reduce visual clutter.

Active State Visibility: It’s hard to tell which tab is currently active.

Fix: Use a high-contrast highlight (like the gold used in the "Start Designing" button) to show the user exactly where they are in the process.

2. Visual Hierarchy & Layout

Headline Dominance: The "Design Your Own Headstones & Memorials" text is massive. While clear, it pushes the actual content (the visual of the headstone) too far down.

Fix: Reduce the font size of the headline by 10-15% and increase the size of the "Start Designing" button.

The "Hero" Image: The 3D render of the headstone at the very bottom is cut off. This is your product—it should be the star of the show.

Fix: Move the headstone image up so it sits side-by-side with the text, or make it the background with an overlay. Show a finished, high-quality render to inspire the user immediately.

Header Links: The links in the top right (Bronze-Plaque.com, etc.) are tiny and hard to read.

Fix: Move these to a footer or a "Our Network" dropdown menu. They distract from the main goal of this specific website.

3. Color & Contrast (Accessibility)

Sidebar Contrast: The grey text on the dark grey background in the sidebar is low contrast. This can be hard for older users (a key demographic for this industry) to read.

Fix: Lighten the text or darken the sidebar background to pure black/charcoal to create a sharper contrast.

Background Gradients: The gradient behind the logo looks a bit muddy and dated.

Fix: Switch to a flat, solid color. It looks more modern and premium.

4. User Experience (UX) Flow

The "Start" Paradox: The main screen asks the user to "Start Designing" (Gold Button), but the sidebar also lists all the design steps immediately.

Fix: Hide the sidebar initially. On the landing page, the focus should be purely on the value proposition. Once they click "Start Designing," then load the interface with the sidebar. This prevents "cognitive overload" where the user feels overwhelmed by options before they've even started.

Trust Signals: You have "Trusted by 5,000+ families," which is excellent.

Fix: Add a visual element to this, such as 5 stars or logos of review platforms (Google Reviews, Trustpilot) to make the claim feel more tangible.

5. UI Elements

Icons: The wireframe icons in the sidebar are a bit generic.

Fix: Use slightly thicker, filled icons that match the "Premium/Gold" aesthetic of the brand.

Buttons: The "Browse Designs" button inside the sidebar (bottom left) competes with the "Browse Designs" button in the center of the screen.

Fix: Remove the one in the sidebar until the user is actually inside the design tool.

Summary Recommendation

The site needs to decide if the homepage is a Landing Page (sales pitch) or the App Interface (tool). Right now, it is trying to be both.

The best approach:
Keep the center content (Headline + Gold Button) as a clean Landing Page. Remove the left sidebar completely from this view. When the user clicks "Start Designing," transition them to a new screen where the sidebar appears and the design process begins.
