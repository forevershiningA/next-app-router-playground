Improving the UX of this configuration panel involves making it more intuitive, precise, and visually organized. Here is a breakdown of suggested improvements:

1. Improve Precision with Text Inputs

Sliders are great for exploring ranges, but very frustrating for inputting exact measurements (e.g., trying to land on exactly 625mm).

Recommendation: Add a small numeric input field next to each label (e.g., "Width: [ 600 ] mm").

Why: Users who have specific cemetery requirements need to type exact numbers quickly.

2. Logical Tab & Toggle Relationship

Currently, you are on the "Headstone" tab, but there is a checkbox for "Add Base." This creates confusion about where the user should be to edit the base.

Recommendation A: Move the "Add Base" checkbox above the tabs. If it’s unchecked, the "Base" tab should be disabled or hidden.

Recommendation B: If "Add Base" stays inside the "Headstone" tab, clicking it should perhaps trigger a "Next: Configure Base" button or automatically switch the tab once the user is done with headstone dimensions.

3. Visual Aids for Types

"Upright" and "Slant" are industry terms, but visual learners will appreciate icons.

Recommendation: Use small illustrative icons next to the radio buttons for "Upright" and "Slant."

Why: It reduces "cognitive load" (the amount of thinking/reading required) and makes the interface more accessible.

4. Slider Consistency and Scale

In your image, the "Thickness" slider is at 100mm and pushed all the way to the left, while "Width" is 600mm and in the middle.

Recommendation: Add "Min" and "Max" value labels at the ends of the sliders (e.g., 0mm and 1200mm).

Why: It gives the user context of the available range. Also, ensure the slider handle position mathematically matches the value (if 600 is the middle, the max must be 1200).

5. Hierarchy and Grouping

The "Add Base" checkbox and the "Upright/Slant" radio buttons are currently on the same horizontal line but perform different functions (one adds an object, the other changes a shape).

Recommendation: Group the "Type" (Upright vs. Slant) separately from the "Dimensions" (Width, Height, Thickness).

Why: This helps the user process the "Shape" first and then the "Size."

6. Visual Contrast and Legibility

The "mm" unit: It is currently very low-contrast (dark grey on dark blue). Make this white or a brighter grey to improve readability.

Active States: Ensure the gold color is used consistently for "active" or "selected" states. The "Headstone" tab is gold, but the "Upright" radio button is a small white dot. Consider making the selected radio button gold to match the branding.

7. Real-time Feedback

Recommendation: Ensure that as the user moves a slider, the 3D model (or preview image) updates instantly.

Why: This creates a "tight feedback loop," which makes the tool feel powerful and satisfying to use.
