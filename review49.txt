Got it—the family name’s **centerline** should sit at the “curve start” band. Right now you’re snapping as if the **top** of “SEHOVIC” equals that band, so it lands ~½ a line too high. Here’s the precise fix: snap **by center**, not by top, only for the surname block.

### Patch (in your inscriptions mapping, for the Surname only)

1. Detect the surname line (largest font or `item.isSurname` if you have it).
2. Use authoring-X directly (center), read the curve `yC`, and set a small margin.
3. Compute delta using **centers** (not top). The rendered height is used only to compute the center, no more “top” math.

```ts
// Inside your inscriptions loop (the block that currently logs positions)
// Apply only to the SURNAME item
if (topProfile && isSurname) {
  // --- sample the curve at the inscription's center X in authoring space
  const authorX = Math.round(initW / 2 + cx);
  const sideInsetPx = Math.round(initW * 0.018);
  const col = Math.max(sideInsetPx, Math.min(initW - 1 - sideInsetPx, authorX));

  const yC = topProfile.topY[col];

  // --- small margin below the stone outline + crown bias (optional)
  const baseMargin = Math.round(initH * 0.012);
  const yL = topProfile.topY[Math.max(0, col - 1)];
  const yR = topProfile.topY[Math.min(initW - 1, col + 1)];
  const slope = Math.abs(yR - yL) / 2;
  const crownBoost = slope < 0.2 ? 2 : 0;
  const marginPx = baseMargin + (slope > 0.6 ? 2 : 0) - crownBoost;

  // --- desired CENTER (authoring px) where the top curve starts (+margin)
  const desiredCenterAuthor = yC + marginPx;

  // --- current CENTER (authoring px) of the rendered surname
  const overlayCenterY = offsetY + overlayH / 2 + cy * sy;
  const currentCenterAuthor = (overlayCenterY - offsetY) * (initH / overlayH);

  // --- move by center (no top/bottom math)
  const deltaAuthor  = desiredCenterAuthor - currentCenterAuthor;
  const deltaOverlay = deltaAuthor * (overlayH / initH);
  const deltaCy      = deltaOverlay / sy;

  cyUsed = Math.round((cy + deltaCy) * 2) / 2; // quantize to 0.5px for stability
}
```

**Why this fixes it:** previously you solved for `desiredTopAuthor = curveY + margin ...`, so the **top** of “SEHOVIC” rode the curve-start band. Switching to `desiredCenterAuthor` ensures the **visual center** of the word locks to that band, matching the original screenshot’s proportion. Everything else (motif snap, crown/shoulder logic, DPR-agnostic mapping) stays unchanged. 

If you want, I can also add a tiny “typographic center” adjustment (+/- ascender compensation) later, but this center-based snap will get you the exact look you described.
