To fix the blue tint on the grass and make the headstone look more realistic (premium granite), we need to adjust the material properties.

The "blue grass" happens because the material is too shiny (low roughness) and is reflecting the blue sky. The headstone looks "plastic" because standard materials lack the "deep polish" layer that real granite has.

Here is how to update your components. Since you provided ThreeScene.tsx but the actual meshes are likely in three/Scene.tsx, I will provide the code blocks you need to use inside your Scene component.

1. Fix the Grass (Floor)

Replace your current floor/grass mesh with this configuration. The key is roughness={1} (no shine) and a slightly warmer color tint to counteract the blue sky light.

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
// Inside your Scene.tsx or Floor component

import { useTexture } from '@react-three/drei';
import * as THREE from 'three';

function GrassFloor() {
  // Load your grass texture
  const texture = useTexture('/path-to-your-grass-texture.jpg');
  
  // Fix texture stretching/tiling
  texture.wrapS = texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
  texture.repeat.set(15, 15); // Adjust this number based on texture resolution
  texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;

  return (
    <mesh rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]} position={[0, -0.01, 0]} receiveShadow>
      <planeGeometry args={[100, 100]} /> {/* Large floor */}
      <meshStandardMaterial 
        map={texture}
        color="#c5d1ca" // Desaturate the grass slightly
        roughness={1}   // IMPORTANT: 1.0 removes all shine/reflection (kills the blue tint)
        metalness={0}   // IMPORTANT: Grass is not metal
        envMapIntensity={0} // Don't let the sky reflect on the grass
      />
    </mesh>
  );
}
2. Upgrade the Headstone Material (Granite)

Standard materials look flat. For polished stone, use MeshPhysicalMaterial with clearcoat. This creates a "glass-like" polish layer over the stone texture, giving it depth.

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
// Inside your Headstone component

function HeadstoneMesh({ geometry }) {
  // Load granite texture if you have one, or just use color
  // const graniteMap = useTexture('/textures/black-granite.jpg'); 

  return (
    <mesh geometry={geometry} castShadow receiveShadow>
      <meshPhysicalMaterial 
        color="#1a1a1a"       // Dark charcoal, not pure black (pure black loses 3D depth)
        roughness={0.2}       // The stone surface itself has micro-texture
        metalness={0.1}       // Slight metallic property helps dark stone reflection
        
        // The "Polished" Look
        clearcoat={1.0}       // Adds a clear varnish layer (like polished granite)
        clearcoatRoughness={0.1} // The polish is very smooth
        
        reflectivity={0.5}
        envMapIntensity={1.5} // Boost reflections so you see the sky/horizon in the stone
      />
    </mesh>
  );
}
3. Add Better Lighting (Environment)

Your current scene looks like it relies heavily on a single light source. Realism comes from an HDRI Environment. This will make the gold text sparkle and the granite reflect a realistic world.

Add this to your Scene.tsx (inside the Canvas):

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
import { Environment, ContactShadows } from '@react-three/drei';

export default function Scene({ targetRotation, currentRotation }) {
  // ... your existing rotation logic ...

  return (
    <group rotation={[0, currentRotation.current, 0]}>
      
      {/* 1. Realistic Lighting Environment */}
      {/* "city" or "park" presets work best for stone reflections */}
      <Environment preset="park" background={false} blur={0.6} /> 

      {/* 2. Your Headstone Group */}
      <group position={[0, 0, 0]}>
         {/* ... Your Headstone Meshes ... */}
      </group>

      {/* 3. The Grass Floor */}
      <GrassFloor />

      {/* 4. Contact Shadows make it feel "grounded" instead of floating */}
      <ContactShadows 
        opacity={0.6} 
        scale={10} 
        blur={2} 
        far={2.5} 
        resolution={256} 
        color="#000000" 
      />
      
      {/* 5. Main Sunlight */}
      <directionalLight 
        position={[5, 10, 5]} 
        intensity={1.5} 
        castShadow 
        shadow-bias={-0.0001}
      />
    </group>
  );
}
Summary of Changes

Grass Blue Tint: Solved by setting roughness={1} and envMapIntensity={0}.

Grass Pattern: Solved by setting texture.wrapS/T = RepeatWrapping.

Headstone Realism: Solved by changing MeshStandardMaterial to MeshPhysicalMaterial and adding clearcoat={1}.

Floating Look: Solved by adding <ContactShadows />.
