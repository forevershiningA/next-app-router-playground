# 1) Page purpose & indexation

* **Keep indexable only the pages that can rank with intent-matching content.**

  * **Index:** `/` (home), “Select Product”, “Select Material”, “Select Motifs”, “Inscriptions” if each has unique copy, examples, FAQs, and internal links.
  * **Consider `noindex` (but follow):** purely functional steps that remain thin even after enhancement (e.g., Size, Additions) to avoid “thin/facet” index bloat.
* Make each indexable step a **mini landing page**: 250–500 words of helpful copy, 6–12 examples, FAQs, and CTAs into the configurator.

# 2) Titles, H1s, and meta (unique per page)

* **Home:**

  * Title: *Design Your Own Headstone Online | Forever Shining Australia*
  * Meta: *Create custom headstones, plaques and monuments. Choose stone, shape, size, inscriptions and motifs. Transparent pricing, Australia-wide delivery.*
  * H1: *Design Your Own Headstone & Memorials Online*
* **Select Product:**

  * Title: *Headstones, Plaques & Monuments – Choose a Product | Forever Shining*
  * Intro paragraph explaining differences, links to exemplar designs, and pricing notes.
* **Select Material:**

  * Title: *Granite & Marble for Headstones – Colours & Finishes | Forever Shining*
  * Add 1–2 sentences per stone (durability, typical use, care).

# 3) Structured data (JSON-LD)

Add first-party JSON-LD, server-rendered (not injected after load):

* **Organization** + **LocalBusiness** (NAP, service area, hours).
* **WebSite** with **SearchAction** (your site search).
* **BreadcrumbList** across the design flow (helps context, esp. desktop). ([Google for Developers][1])
* **Product** for each purchasable configuration/representative SKU; include `name`, `image`, `brand`, `offers` (price, availability), `material`, `color`. ([Google for Developers][2])
* **ItemList** on Select Product/Material pages (lists of products/materials). ([Google for Developers][3])
* **FAQPage** blocks on pages with Q&A (care, cemetery rules, lead time). ([Google for Developers][4])
  Ensure structured data is **present in HTML at response** and matches on-page content. ([Google for Developers][5])

# 4) Content to win intent

* **Home:** short explainer of the DYO system, trust signals (years in business, foundry), real photos, reviews, delivery/installation explainer, and links to top categories (“Traditional Headstones”, “Bronze Plaques”, “Full Monuments”).
* **Select Product:** card grid with **descriptive text under each card** (what it is best for, typical sizes, finish options); link to **example designs** and **price ranges**.
* **Select Material:** each material gets: photo, origin, grain, polish, suitability, maintenance, and 1–2 example images.
* Add **FAQ** sections (and schema) answering pricing, cemetery regulations by state, lead times, fixing methods, warranties. ([Google for Developers][4])

# 5) Media & alt text

* Convert preview images to **AVIF/WebP** with width/height attributes to prevent CLS.
* **Alt text** formula: `[Material] granite headstone – [shape], [finish], example` (unique on each card).
* Create an **image sitemap** for gallery/example images.

# 6) Technical JS/Rendering

Your app is JS-heavy; make sure Google gets content server-side: SSR/SSG for headings, copy, card lists, and JSON-LD. If any step is client-only, pre-render a useful fallback (copy + links). ([Google for Developers][6])

# 7) Core Web Vitals (ranked by impact)

* **LCP:** pre-load the hero image; serve it as static, compressed (AVIF/WebP), and avoid 3D assets on initial paint (defer heavy 3D libs until user opens 3D).
* **INP:** reduce JS on first view; split routes so configurator logic loads only when needed; avoid long tasks (>200ms).
* **CLS:** set fixed sizes for cards, thumbnails, and toolbar; use font-display `swap`. ([Google for Developers][7])

# 8) Internal linking & navigation

* From **Home**, link to: Traditional Headstones, Bronze Plaques, Stainless Plaques, Full Monuments, Materials index, and “How It Works”.
* On **Select Product**, add **topical blocks** linking to shape landing pages (“Curved Gable Headstones”, “Serpentine Headstones”), and **learn** pages (care, installation, regulations).
* Add **breadcrumbs** across the flow; note mobile SERPs show domain only more often now, but breadcrumbs still matter on desktop and for context. ([The Verge][8])

# 9) Canonicals, parameters & sitemaps

* Use **self-referencing canonicals** on clean step URLs.
* If the configurator adds query/hash state, keep a **clean canonical** to the base template.
* Maintain XML **sitemaps** for main pages, designs, and images; update when adding new example designs.

# 10) E-E-A-T & trust

* Prominent **About/Manufacturing** page (photos of foundry/workshop), staff credentials, memberships, warranty terms, return/refund policies, and **reviews** (with `AggregateRating` when applicable). ([Google for Developers][2])

# 11) Local signals (Australia)

* Show NAP (address/phone) in the footer and in **LocalBusiness** schema; link to your Google Business Profile; embed a service-area map.

# 12) Programmatic SEO (your strength)

* Create template landing pages for each **shape × material × size** combo with auto-generated copy (curated, not spun), example renders, FAQs, and internal links back into the DYO with **pre-selected state** (link tokens).
* Publish **guides**: “Headstone sizes by cemetery/state”, “Granite vs Bronze for coastal cemeteries”, “How to design inscriptions”.

## Quick wins you can do this week

1. Add **100–200 words** of unique copy + FAQ to **Select Product** and **Select Material** and ship JSON-LD (Organization, WebSite, BreadcrumbList, ItemList). ([Google for Developers][1])
2. **SSR** the headings, grid items, and schema on all menu pages. ([Google for Developers][6])
3. Optimize hero and material thumbnails (AVIF/WebP) and set explicit dimensions to improve **LCP/CLS**. ([Google for Developers][7])
4. Add **internal links** from Home to your top revenue categories and 3–5 best example designs.
5. Decide which thin steps should **noindex** (while keeping `follow`) if you don’t plan to enrich them.

If you want, I can draft the actual JSON-LD blocks (Organization/WebSite/BreadcrumbList/Product/ItemList/FAQPage) and sample copy for **Select Product** and **Select Material** so you can paste them straight into Next.js.
