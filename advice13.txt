To make your first headstone image look like a real slant headstone in Three.js, you'll want to adjust its geometry and potentially its material to better reflect the shape and common features of a slant monument.

Here's what you can do:

Adjust the Main Block Geometry:

Shape: Instead of a simple rectangular prism, you'll need to create a trapezoidal prism or carefully manipulate vertices. A common slant headstone has a wider base and a top that slants back.

Extrusion along a path: You could define a 2D shape (the profile of the slant) and then extrude it to give it depth.

Manual Vertex Positioning: If you're using a BufferGeometry, you can manually define the vertices to create the desired slant.

Add a Base (if not already separate):

Slant headstones almost always sit on a separate, usually wider, rectangular base. You'll need a distinct, simpler BoxGeometry for this. Position the main headstone block on top of this base.

Refine the Top Edge (Optional but good for realism):

The top edge of a slant headstone is often rounded or chamfered. You can achieve this by adding more complex geometry or by using a RoundedBoxGeometry if available in a library, or by carefully manipulating vertices.

Material and Textures:

Material: Use a MeshStandardMaterial or MeshPhysicalMaterial for better lighting and reflections.

Roughness and Metalness: Adjust these properties to give the stone a more realistic feel. Stone is generally not very metallic.

Normal Map/Bump Map: For subtle surface imperfections and the texture of granite, a normal map or bump map would greatly enhance realism. You can generate these from a granite texture.

Color/Albedo Map: Apply your dark gray granite texture as the map (albedo).

Lighting:

Shadows: Enable shadows on your light sources (DirectionalLight or SpotLight) and your renderer to give the headstone depth and ground it in the scene.

Multiple Lights: Use a combination of lights (e.g., a main light and a subtle fill light) to create more natural illumination.

Text and Decorations:

Text: For the engraved text, you can use TextGeometry from Three.js examples (requires typeface.json fonts) or render text as a texture and apply it. To make it appear "cut in" or raised, you can play with normal maps or subtle 3D effects.

Cross/Dove/Angel: These could be separate 3D models (GLTFLoader is excellent for this) positioned on the main headstone.
