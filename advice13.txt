This section acts as your final Call to Action (CTA). Its job is to catch the user who has scrolled to the bottom but hasn't clicked yet.

Currently, it suffers from "Box Overload." You have text inside boxes, inside a larger box, inside a container. It feels bureaucratic and constrictive, rather than open and inviting.

Here is how to open this up and increase conversion:

1. "De-Box" the Design (Layout)

The large outlined rectangle containing the features and testimonial is unnecessary visual noise. It looks like a spreadsheet or a pricing table.

The Fix: Remove the large outer border entirely.

The Features: Take the three feature blocks ("Design in minutes", "Instant proof", "Personal designer") out of their grey boxes. Just let the Icon + Bold Title + Text sit cleanly on the black background.

Arrangement: Instead of a grid of boxes, arrange these three features in a horizontal row underneath the buttons. This creates a "Foundation of Trust" below the main action.

2. Elevate the Testimonial (Social Proof)

The testimonial from "Sarah & Liam" is currently buried at the bottom of a box. It looks like a footer note.

The Fix: Move the testimonial to the Right Side of the screen (creating a 2-column layout).

Visuals: Make the text large and elegant (italic serif font).

Human Element: If possible, add 5 gold stars above it, or a subtle background image of a peaceful landscape behind it.

Why: Putting the human story next to the "Start" button validates the decision emotionally.

3. Warm Up the Copywriting

The headline "Ready to Create Your Memorial?" is functional but a bit cold.

New Headline: "Create a Tribute Worthy of Their Memory."

New Sub-text: Change "Start designing in minutes..." to "Take your time. Experiment with designs, get family feedback, and only order when you are 100% ready." (This relieves pressure).

4. Refine the Buttons (The "Escape Hatch")

You have a good dual-button setup, but the hierarchy can be sharper.

Primary Button (Gold): "Start Your Free Design" (Adding "Free" here is a huge click-driver).

Secondary Button (Outline): "Request a Designer's Help."

Insight: Many older users are intimidated by "3D Tools." They want to know a human will help them. Make sure the "Designer" option feels like a safe "escape hatch" for non-tech-savvy users.

Summary

By removing the heavy borders and boxes, you make the brand feel more premium and accessible. By moving the testimonial next to the buttons, you replace "fear of technology" with "social reassurance."
