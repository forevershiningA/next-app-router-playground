Create a Distinct Horizon Line (The Floor)
In your old design, you had a clear line where the wall met the floor. You need to recreate that, but with premium colors.
The Concept: Top half = Night Sky / Black Wall. Bottom half = Polished Wood or Stone Floor.
The CSS Fix: instead of a round spotlight, use a Linear Gradient that splits the screen.
The Colors: Use a Dark Bronze/Coffee color for the floor. It is lighter than black (so you can see the base) but warm (so it fits the brand).
Visual Code Idea:
code
CSS
background: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    #000000 0%,      /* Top is black */
    #000000 60%,     /* Stays black until the "Horizon" */
    #2a221b 60%,     /* Horizon Line starts (Dark Brown) */
    #4a3b2e 100%     /* Fades to lighter bronze at bottom */
);
2. Bring Back the Reflection (Crucial)
The main reason the old design felt "grounded" was the reflection under the headstone. Your new design doesn't have it.
The Fix: Enable the reflection in your 3D viewer.
Style: It shouldn't be a perfect mirror (like the old one). It should be blurred and faded (20% opacity).
Why: A reflection instantly tells the human brain "This object is sitting on a solid floor," even if the background is dark.
3. Add "Rim Lighting" to the Stone
The black granite is blending into the black background.
The Fix: Add a Backlight in your 3D scene.
Effect: This creates a thin, bright white/gold outline along the edges of the headstone.
Why: This physically separates the dark object from the dark background, making it "pop" without needing to make the whole background bright white.
