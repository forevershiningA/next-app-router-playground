This is looking very polished. You’ve successfully added the "safety" micro-copy and the navigation arrows, which communicate that the 3D model is interactive or that there are multiple styles to view.

To reach that final "10/10" premium feel, here are the last four elements to implement:

1. The "Halo" Effect (Crucial)

The headstone is still a dark object on a dark background.

The Fix: Place a very soft, large, circular radial gradient behind the headstone. Make the center of the glow a warm, light brown or amber color (to match your theme).

The Result: This will "lift" the headstone off the page, making it the undeniable star of the show.

2. Add Visual Tool Affordances (Color Swatches)

Right now, the only way I know I can change the design is by clicking "Start Designing."

The Fix: Add 3–4 small circular material swatches floating subtly to the right of the headstone. One circle should look like grey granite, one like red marble, one like black polished stone.

The Result: This is a powerful psychological trigger. It shows the user they can customize it before they even click a button.

3. Ground the Model

The headstone currently looks like it’s floating in a void.

The Fix: Add a very soft, blurred contact shadow right where the base of the headstone meets the "floor."

The Result: This gives the object "weight" and makes it feel like a real physical product rather than a digital asset.

4. Frame it with a Header

To make this look like a completed website rather than just a graphic:

The Fix: Add a simple top navigation bar. Put a placeholder logo on the top left (e.g., "Eternal Memorials" in a nice serif) and 3-4 simple links on the top right (e.g., Our Work, Pricing, Process, FAQ).

The Result: This anchors the entire composition and makes it feel like a professional, established business.

Summary of the Vibe:
You’ve done the hard work of getting the typography and layout right. These final steps are all about Lighting and Depth. If you add that glow behind the stone and the material swatches, you’ll have a world-class hero section.

One minor tweak: The micro-copy under the buttons ("No credit card required...") is a bit dark. Try making it just 10% brighter so it’s easily readable, as it's a very strong selling point!
