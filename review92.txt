Diffrences between 1st screen (original) and second ours.

Here’s what’s off in the second render vs the original screen (first image):

* **Canvas/fit**

  * Headstone is **zoomed in**; the **base block is missing** (cropped out).
  * Overall proportions look taller; everything is pushed **up toward the crown**.

* **Top motif + title**

  * The leaf-and-bird motif is **larger and lower**, crowding the word **PINTO** (in the original it sits higher with more air).
  * The inscription below shows the entity text **“Heaven's”** instead of **“Heaven’s”** (HTML entity not decoded).
  * Spacing between **PINTO** and the prayer line is tighter than in the original.

* **Center statue**

  * The Madonna figure is **shifted right and slightly higher**; in the original it’s centered and a touch lower.

* **Name blocks**

  * **JOHN TIMOTHY** block (left) is **too far toward center and too high**.
  * **TERESA ISABELLA / NEE SALDANHA** block (right) is **too far left and too high**, partially colliding with the statue; line spacing looks tighter than in the original.

* **Lower motifs**

  * **Lotus (left)** is **smaller and higher** than in the original.
  * **Cross (right)** is **smaller, too far left**, and there’s a **ghosted dotted circle/artefact** visible that isn’t present (or isn’t visible) in the original.

* **General scaling**

  * Decorative motifs and text are **scaled inconsistently** relative to the headstone outline; the original has more balanced margins all around.
