Great question — this screen actually looks polished visually, but the *cognitive load is high*.
Right now users must **interpret the interface** instead of simply *reading it*.
Clarity improves when the UI answers 3 questions instantly:

> 1. Where am I?
> 2. What can I do?
> 3. What needs my attention?

Below is a focused breakdown of what’s causing friction and how to fix it.

---

## 1) Top Area: “Account Menu” feels like a dashboard *and* navigation

### Problem

Those 6 cards behave like navigation, but visually they look like content widgets.

So users pause to decide:

> Are these shortcuts, status indicators, or actions?

Also “Production window opens Mar 12” floats alone — unclear relevance.

### Improve

Turn it into a **true navigation bar**, not a card grid.

**Do this:**

* Convert the 6 cards into tabs or segmented navigation
* Move “Production window opens…” inside Orders section
* Highlight current section clearly

**Example structure**

**My Account**

* Designs (active)
* Orders
* Billing
* Account Details
* Privacy

Right now:
🧠 Users scan → interpret → decide
After fix:
👁 Users scan → understand immediately

---

## 2) Page Identity: “Saved Designs” is weakly anchored

### Problem

The page header competes with the cards above it.
The user doesn’t instantly feel they entered a *new section*.

### Improve

Make the section unmistakable:

**Add a page header zone**

```
MY ACCOUNT
Saved Designs
Manage and approve your memorial concepts
[ + New Design ]   [ Export ]
```

Increase vertical spacing above it.
This visually resets context.

---

## 3) Design Cards: Too much mixed hierarchy

Currently each card contains:

* status
* title
* product
* description
* timestamp
* price
* preview
* 5 buttons

Users must scan in Z-pattern twice.

### Key issue

You’re mixing **information density with decision density**.

Users want to know:

> Do I need to act on this?

But the UI shows everything equally.

---

## Fix the Card Structure

### Current mental effort:

> read → decode → locate actions → compare → remember

### New structure:

Separate into 3 zones:

---

### A) Status Row (most important)

Make this bold and colored — this is the user's priority filter.

Instead of:
`DESIGN PROOF`

Use:

* Awaiting Approval
* Ready to Order
* In Production
* Completed

Add color indicator dot.

---

### B) Content Summary (scannable)

Reduce text dramatically.

**Before**
Paragraph biography text = noise in list view.

**After**
Show only essentials:

```
Mother Memorial
Black Granite Headstone
Last edited: Oct 30, 05:03
```

Full description belongs inside detail page.

---

### C) Actions (primary vs secondary)

Right now:
`EDIT | BUY | EMAIL | MORE`

All equal weight = hesitation.

Make ONE primary action.

Example rules:

* Awaiting approval → **Review Proof**
* Ready → **Order**
* Ordered → **Track**

Everything else → inside overflow menu (⋯)

---

## 4) Preview Image Dominates Decision Area

The preview is large but not actionable.

### Problem

The eye goes to the image first — but the user cannot act from it.

### Improve

* Reduce preview size
* Make it clickable to open proof modal
* Put actions near title (not bottom row)

This cuts scanning time in half.

---

## 5) Sidebar Steps Cause Context Conflict

The left panel shows **design builder steps** while user is in **account management**.

So the brain asks:

> Am I editing or managing?

This is a major clarity leak.

### Fix

When inside My Account:

* Collapse builder steps
* Replace with account navigation

Builder steps should only appear inside the editor.

---

## 6) Dates & Time

`Updated 30-10-2025 05:03`

For most users:

* unreadable format
* not meaningful

### Improve

Use human language:

* Updated 2 hours ago
* Yesterday
* Oct 30

---

## 7) Missing Filtering (Huge clarity gain)

Users with many designs will struggle fast.

Add filters:

* Status
* Recently edited
* Ready for approval
* Ordered

This dramatically reduces scanning fatigue.

---

## 8) Visual Priority Map (what the eye should see)

Current:
Logo → cards → image → buttons → title → status

Desired:
Status → Title → Primary action → preview → details

---

## Biggest Impact Changes (Do these first)

If you only implement 5 improvements, choose these:

1. Convert top card grid into navigation tabs
2. Replace “Design Proof” with real statuses
3. One primary action per design
4. Remove description text from list view
5. Hide builder steps in account area

These alone will make the page feel 3× clearer.

## Quick Clarity Test

After redesign, a new user should answer in under 3 seconds:

> “I have 2 designs waiting for approval and I can review them here.”

Right now they must *study* the interface to understand that.
