This design is functionally excellent. The layout, hierarchy, and text placement are now perfect. The user knows exactly what to do, and the interface is clean.

However, the visual realism of the stone itself is the last remaining hurdle. Currently, the "Base" looks like a soft shadow or a floating pill, which breaks the illusion of a heavy, solid monument.

Here are the final 3 visual tweaks to make this look like a real physical product:

1. Fix the Base (The "Floating Pill" Problem)

The dark shape at the bottom looks like a rounded button or a shadow.

The Reality: Real headstones sit on a Base (a rectangular block of stone). It is heavy and has corners.

The Fix: Change that rounded "pill" shape into a Trapezoid or Rectangle with defined edges. It needs to look like a solid block of granite that is supporting the weight of the heart.

Lighting: Give the top edge of this base a slight highlight so we can see it has a top surface.

2. Make the Stone Look "Hard" (Material)

The heart currently has a soft, diffuse gradient. This makes it look like rubber or matte plastic. Polished granite is hard and glass-like.

The Fix: Tighten the highlights.

Instead of a big soft white glow, use sharper, thinner white lines on the edges (especially the top curve).

Contrast: Make the center of the stone darker (almost pure black) and the highlights brighter. High contrast = Polished Stone. Low contrast = Rubber.

3. The "Engraving" Effect

The text "In our hearts..." is much better sized now, but it still looks like a sticker.

The Fix: Add an Inner Shadow (top-left direction) and a tiny Drop Shadow (bottom-right, white, very faint).

Why: This creates the optical illusion that the letters are carved into the stone (V-cut), rather than printed on top of it.

Final "Gold" Tweak

Button Color: The "Start Customizing" button is a bit "mustard yellow." Shift the hue slightly towards Amber/Orange (e.g., #E5B80B) to make it look more like metallic gold and less like dark yellow.

Verdict: The layout is done. Don't change the text or the boxes anymore. Just focus entirely on refining that central image to look like a heavy, shiny, carved block of stone.
