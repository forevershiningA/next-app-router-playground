This section is clear and easy to follow, but it feels a bit "boxy" and standard compared to the premium, atmospheric hero section you’ve built.

Here is how to make this section feel more high-end and cohesive with the rest of the site:

1. Fix the "Highlight" Logic

Currently, Step 4 is the only one with a gold badge. This makes it look like the user is currently on Step 4, or that "Paying" is the most important part.

The Fix: Make Step 1 the gold badge (to show where to start), or make all the icons gold while keeping the "Step" badges subtle.

Why: You want to highlight the beginning of the journey to lower the barrier to entry.

2. Industry-Specific Iconography

The current icons (pencil, paintbrush, cube) are a bit generic—they look like they belong on a graphic design tool website.

The Fix:

Step 1: Use an icon that looks like a simplified headstone shape.

Step 2: Use a "T" with a cursor to represent text and font customization.

Step 3: Use a small flower or a decorative scroll icon to represent "motifs/details."

Step 4: Use a price tag icon or a "checkmark" icon to represent completion.

3. Create a "Flow" (Visual Connection)

Right now, these look like four separate boxes. You want them to feel like a sequence.

The Fix: Add a subtle dotted line or a soft arrow connecting the cards.

Alternatively: Use a "stepper" line at the very top that connects the "Step 1, Step 2..." pills. This guides the eye from left to right naturally.

4. Match the "Warmth" of the Hero

The background here looks like a cooler dark grey/black, whereas your hero section has a beautiful warm chocolate/brown tone.

The Fix: Use the same dark brown background color from the hero section.

Add Depth: Give the cards a very thin (1px) border in a slightly lighter brown or a very faint "glow" so they don't look flat against the background.

5. Refine the Card Design

Typography: The description text is a bit small. Increase the line height (leading) slightly to make it feel more "breathable" and premium.

The "Step" Badges: Instead of a dark grey bubble, try making them just text: 01, 02, 03, 04 in a large, low-opacity serif font in the background of each card. It adds a high-end "editorial" look.

6. Add a Final CTA

After someone reads "How It Works," their next logical thought is: "Okay, let's do it."

The Fix: Add a single "Start Your Design" button (the same gold one from the hero) centered underneath these four cards. This prevents the user from having to scroll back up to find the "Start" button.

Visual Idea for the "Pro" Look:
Imagine if the background of each card had a very faint, zoomed-in texture of stone (granite, marble). It would subtly reinforce what the business is about without being distracting.
