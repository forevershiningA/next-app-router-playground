Audit Report: AdditionModel.tsx
Overview
AdditionModel
 handles the loading, positioning, and interaction (drag/drop) of 3D addition models (statues, vases, applications). It supports GLB loading, texture application, and coordinate conversion between the store (Y-down) and the scene (Y-up).

Findings
1. Unused Variable
Location: Line 71 (dirNum).
Issue: dirNum is calculated but only used in Line 75. Wait, it IS used in Line 75: useTexture(\/additions/${dirNum}/colorMap.webp`)`.
Correction: It is used. My initial scan was wrong.
2. Memory Management (Cloned Scene)
Location: Line 84 (gltf.scene.clone(true)).
Issue: The cloned scene and its materials/geometries are created in useMemo.
Observation:
Geometries and Materials from useGLTF are cached globally. Cloning the scene shares geometries but clones materials (if clone(true) does deep clone).
Line 236 creates new materials for every mesh in the scene inside useEffect.
These new materials are never disposed.
Impact: Memory leak. Every time 
AdditionModel
 mounts or scene is re-memoized, new materials are created and left in memory.
Recommendation: Add a cleanup function in the useEffect (Lines 222-251) to dispose of the materials created there.
3. Hardcoded Logic & Magic Numbers
Location: Lines 308-314 (Default Positions), Lines 326-328 (Target Heights), Line 352 (Z Offset).
Issue: Specific logic for 'statue', 'vase' and magic numbers (80, 30, 15, 12, 1.5).
Impact: brittle code. If new types are added, this needs updating.
Recommendation: Move these configuration values to the data definition or constants.
4. Coordinate System Conversion
Location: Line 361 (centerY - offset.yPos), Line 367 (scale={[finalScale, -finalScale, finalScale]}).
Analysis:
The code explicitly handles the Y-flip:
offset.yPos is negated/subtracted to match Y-down store vs Y-up scene.
The mesh group is scaled by -finalScale in Y to flip the model (which was rotated 180 Z in Line 109? Wait).
Line 109: cloned.rotation.z = Math.PI. This rotates 180 around Z.
Line 367: Scale Y is negative.
Complexity: There are multiple flips/rotations happening.
rotation.z = PI -> X becomes -X, Y becomes -Y.
scale Y = -1 -> Y becomes -(-Y) = +Y.
Net result: X is flipped?
Recommendation: Verify visual correctness. If it works, document WHY this combination is used. It seems overly complex.
5. Event Listener Cleanup
Location: Line 277.
canvas.removeEventListener('pointermove', onMove);
Issue: window.removeEventListener('pointerup', onUp) is missing in the cleanup function!
Impact: If component unmounts while dragging (rare but possible), 
onUp
 listener remains on window.
Recommendation: Add window.removeEventListener('pointerup', onUp) to cleanup.
Action Plan
Fix Memory Leak: Dispose materials in useEffect.
Fix Event Cleanup: Remove pointerup listener.
