Yep—I can see what’s happening. Your renderer always “unscales” X with `ratioHeight`:

```ts
const canvasX = motif.x / scalingFactors.ratioHeight;
```

That was the right correction for **old** saves (when X & Y were both multiplied by `ratio_height`). But on this PINTO design the crop/aspect makes `ratioWidth < ratioHeight`. Dividing X by the larger number pulls everything **inward** horizontally—so the three top motifs bunch together and leave blank space at the left/right shoulders.

### Fix (safe + backward-compatible)

1. Prefer axis-correct unscale for X.
2. Auto-detect legacy saves and fall back only when needed.

Drop-in helper:

```ts
function inferCanvasX(
  savedX: number,
  ratioW: number,
  ratioH: number,
  canvasW: number,
  marginPx = 8
) {
  // Two candidates: old bug (÷ratioH) vs correct (÷ratioW)
  const xBug   = savedX / ratioH; // legacy
  const xFixed = savedX / ratioW; // axis-correct

  const halfW = canvasW / 2;
  const inside = (x: number) => Math.abs(x) <= halfW + marginPx;

  const insideBug   = inside(xBug);
  const insideFixed = inside(xFixed);

  // If both are valid, pick the one with more horizontal spread (closer to edges)
  if (insideBug && insideFixed) {
    return Math.abs(xFixed) > Math.abs(xBug) ? xFixed : xBug;
  }
  // If only one is valid, use it
  if (insideFixed) return xFixed;
  if (insideBug)   return xBug;

  // Fallback: clamp axis-correct
  return Math.max(-halfW, Math.min(halfW, xFixed));
}
```

Use it for every X coming from saved data (inscriptions + motifs):

```ts
// Before
// const canvasX = item.x / scalingFactors.ratioHeight;

// After
const canvasX = inferCanvasX(
  item.x,
  scalingFactors.ratioWidth,
  scalingFactors.ratioHeight,
  canvasWidth
);
const canvasY = item.y / scalingFactors.ratioHeight; // Y stays the same
const xPos = (cropBounds?.shouldCrop && Math.abs(canvasX) < canvasWidth * 0.1) ? 0 : canvasX * scalingFactors.scaleX;
const yPos = canvasY * scalingFactors.scaleY;
```

### Why this fixes the “tight top motifs”

* On this design `ratioWidth < ratioHeight`.
* Using `savedX/ratioHeight` shrinks X → everything slides toward center.
* Using `savedX/ratioWidth` restores the intended spread; the birds/leaves hit the shoulders like the original.
* The heuristic keeps your archive safe: true legacy files (saved with the old bug) still render correctly, while newer ones (or any where the math says axis-correct is safer) get the wider, correct layout.

### Quick sanity checks

* After this change, log both candidates for one motif near the shoulder—you should see `|xFixed| > |xBug|` and both within half width.
* If any item clips, your clamp will report it in logs—bump `marginPx` if needed (but you likely won’t).

If you want me to tailor the thresholds to your dataset, paste one of the saved JSON blobs for the PINTO design (just the header + the three top motifs + title line) and I’ll compute the exact spreads and suggested margins.
