You're right—the motifs are being sized only from the SVG’s natural dimensions × the saved `ratio`, and we ignore the saved `height`. That makes them look too small on many designs.

### What to change (in `DesignPageClient.tsx`)

In the **Motifs Layer** where we compute `motifWidth`/`motifHeight`, replace the current size logic with one that:

1. **Prefers the saved `height` (authoring units)**
2. **Normalizes legacy “physical-px” heights by the design DPR** (same idea as inscriptions)
3. **Keeps aspect from the SVG**
4. Falls back to `ratio × svgDims` if no `height` is present.

You’ll find the block here (the spot that currently sets `motifWidth = svgDims.width * motifRatio; motifHeight = svgDims.height * motifRatio;`). 

#### Patch

```tsx
// Use motif ratio (scale) to calculate size
const motifRatio = parseFloat(motif.ratio || '1');
const motifSrc = motif.src || motif.name;
const svgDims = motifDimensions[motifSrc];

// --- NEW: robust sizing ---
// 1) Prefer saved height (authoring space). If it's suspiciously large,
//    treat it as legacy physical pixels and normalize by DPR (like inscriptions).
const designDpr = scalingFactors.designDpr || 1;
const canvasH = scalingFactors.initH || 600;

let heightFromSave: number | undefined = typeof motif.height === 'number' ? motif.height : undefined;
if (heightFromSave && heightFromSave > canvasH * 0.8) {
  // Likely physical px from a high-DPR capture -> normalize
  heightFromSave = heightFromSave / designDpr;
}

// 2) Determine aspect from SVG dims when we have them
const aspect = svgDims && svgDims.height > 0 ? svgDims.width / svgDims.height : 1;

// 3) Final height/width
let motifHeight = heightFromSave
  ?? (svgDims ? svgDims.height * motifRatio : 100);     // fallback

let motifWidth = heightFromSave
  ? (heightFromSave * aspect)
  : (svgDims ? svgDims.width * motifRatio : 100);

// 4) Guard rails (very small/very large)
const minH = 24;                       // don’t let motifs vanish
const maxH = canvasH * 0.5;            // avoid absurd sizes
motifHeight = Math.min(Math.max(motifHeight, minH), maxH);
motifWidth  = Math.max(motifWidth, minH * aspect);
```

Everything else (flip/rotate, position, container scaling) can stay as is.

### Why this fixes it

* Many of your saved records already carry a **meaningful `height`** (e.g., 181 for the central Madonna; birds ~44–53). In the current code we ignore it and compute from `ratio`, which underestimates on some files. Using `height` first restores authoring-space intent.
* If a legacy save stored **physical pixels**, we downscale by the design DPR—exactly like we do for inscription font sizes. (See the inscription DPR normalization pattern for reference.) 
* When there’s no `height`, we still support the **ratio × SVG natural size** path you already built. 

After this change, motifs will match the proportions you see in the “good” render (right-hand image) and won’t come out tiny on iPhone/high-DPR captures.

If you want a belt-and-braces option, you can also clamp motifs to, say, **3%–40%** of the headstone’s authoring height by replacing `minH/maxH` with percentages of `canvasH`.
