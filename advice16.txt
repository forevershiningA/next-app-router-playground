The current footer is too sparse and functional. It looks like the footer of a domain parking page rather than a premium memorial design studio.

When a user scrolls to the bottom, they are looking for Trust (Contact info), Navigation (Where do I go next?), or Reassurance (Policies).

Here is how to transform this into a professional, "fat footer" that builds confidence.

1. Change the Layout to 4 Columns

Instead of a single horizontal bar, expand the footer vertically into 4 distinct columns. This makes the business look established and substantial.

Column 1: Brand & Story

Logo: Place your actual logo here (not just text).

Tagline: A short sentence like "Crafting lasting tributes for families since 20XX."

Social Icons: Small, tasteful icons (Instagram, Facebook) in gold.

Column 2: Products (SEO & Navigation)

Heading: Memorials

Links:

Headstones

Plaques

Urns

Full Monuments

Pet Memorials

Column 3: Support

Heading: Help & Guides

Links:

How it Works

Pricing Guide

Material Guide

FAQ

Contact Us

Column 4: Contact (Crucial for Trust)

Heading: Get in Touch

Phone Number: (Make this large and clickable). People need to know they can call a human.

Email: support@forevershining...

Physical Address: Even if you are online-only, having a registered address here proves you aren't a scam.

2. Fix the "Partner Network" Issue

Currently, the links to "Bronze-Plaque.com" and "HeadstonesDesigner.com" look a bit like spammy SEO links.

The Fix: Remove this section from the main visual hierarchy. If you must keep them for SEO, move them to the very bottom copyright bar and make them small and subtle. Do not let them compete with your main brand.

3. Visual Styling (The "Gold" Thread)

Border: Add a thin Gold Border (1px) at the very top of the footer to separate it from the rest of the page.

Colors: Keep the background almost black (#0a0a0a). Make the headings White/Gold and the body text Light Grey (#cccccc).

Typography: Use your serif font (the "fancy" one) for the Column Headings, and the clean sans-serif for the links.

4. The Bottom Bar (Copyright)

Keep the bottom strip, but organize it better:

Left: © 2025 Forever Shining. All rights reserved.

Right: Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | Sitemap

(Optional): Add small payment icons (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal) in the bottom right corner. This is a subtle psychological trigger that says "Safe Checkout."

Summary of the Transformation

Current Vibe: "This is a temporary website."
New Vibe: "This is a reputable, established design studio."

By adding the Contact Column and the Product Links, you stop the user from hitting a "dead end" and give them reasons to stay on the site.
