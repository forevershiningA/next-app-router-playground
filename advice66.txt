This is coming along very well. The layout is balanced, the typography is strong, and the "Start Designing" button really pops now with that glow effect.

To move from "good design" to "high-end premium experience," you now need to focus on the realism and emotion of the center image.

Here are the next specific steps to take:

1. Give the Headstone "Life" (The Inscription)

A blank headstone can feel a bit ominous or "empty." Adding a sample inscription immediately makes the product feel like a memorial.

Action: Add a placeholder name and dates (e.g., “In Loving Memory / Jonathan R. Miller / 1954 – 2023”) in a clean, engraved-looking font.

Why: This helps the user visualize the final result and proves that your "design system" can handle text beautifully.

2. Texture is Everything

Currently, the stone looks like a matte plastic or a dark shadow.

Action: Apply a high-resolution Granite or Marble texture. Even if you want it to be black, give it that "polished stone" look with some subtle "grain" or speckles.

Highlight the Edges: Add a "rim light" or sharper highlights on the chamfered (beveled) edges of the 3D model. This makes it look expensive and high-quality.

3. Hint at Interactivity (The "UI Overlay")

Since the text mentions an "intuitive 3D design system," show the user a tiny bit of how it works right in the hero section.

Action: Place 3 or 4 small circular color swatches (e.g., Light Grey, Black Granite, Mahogany Red, Marble White) floating subtly to the left or right of the stone.

Effect: This tells the user's brain: "I can click this and it will change." It turns a static image into a "preview" of the tool.

4. Ground the Object

The headstone is currently floating in space.

Action: Add a soft, blurred shadow directly underneath the base.

Optional: Add a very faint "glow" or a circular gradient behind the headstone (similar to the glow you put under the button) to separate it from the dark background and make it the focal point.

5. Final Polish on Trust Signals

The icons at the bottom are good, but they are a bit hard to read.

Action: Increase the font size slightly and perhaps make the gold color of the icons a tiny bit brighter to match the "Start Designing" button. This ties the whole page together visually.

Visual Check:
Imagine if you added a small "360° View" icon or a small mouse-drag icon near the headstone. That would immediately communicate that this is a modern, high-tech way to handle a sensitive task.

Current Verdict: You have a solid structure. Now you just need to "sell the stone" by making it look like a real, premium physical product.
