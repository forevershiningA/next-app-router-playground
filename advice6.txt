This layout is structurally excellent. You have successfully moved from a cluttered "dashboard" look to a clean, narrative-driven "journey." The balance between the text on the left and the image on the right is perfect for a landing page.

However, the visual execution still has a few "rough edges" that make it feel like software rather than a premium experience.

Here are the final 4 steps to polish this to perfection:

1. The "Screenshot" Issue (Critical Fix)

The image on the right currently looks like a raw screenshot of a tool in "Edit Mode." It breaks the emotional immersion.

Remove the Selection Brackets: You see those white corners/brackets around the text and the stone? Those are UI elements showing what is "selected." In a marketing image, these must be hidden. The user wants to see the finished tribute, not the wireframe.

Remove the Floating Label: The text box floating in the sky ("Traditional Engraved Headstone") looks like a software tooltip. Hide it.

Crop the Left Edge: On the far left of the image, there is a dark vertical strip showing buttons like "Base" and "Stand." Crop the image slightly to cut this out.

The Goal: The image should look like a photograph of a headstone in a park, not a screenshot of a computer screen.

2. Fix the "Uneven Cards"

Look at your three Phase cards (1, 2, and 3).

The Issue: Phase 3 ("Gather family input") is shorter than Phase 1 and 2 because it has less text. This creates an uneven, jagged bottom line.

The Fix: Force all three cards to be the same height (use CSS flex-grow or min-height). This creates a solid, confident horizontal line that feels more organized.

3. Differentiate the Bottom Rows

You currently have two rows of dark boxes stacked at the bottom:

The Feature Row (Eye, Document, Bookmark icons)

The Stats Row (5,284 families, etc.)

Because they are both "dark grey boxes on black," they blend together into a "wall of boxes."

The Fix: Make the Feature Row (Middle row) invisible or different.

Option A: Remove the background color from the middle row completely. Just leave the Gold Icon + Text floating on the black background. This separates it from the Stats row below.

Option B: Make the icons much larger and center the text, getting rid of the borders entirely.

4. Connect the Journey

The three Phase cards stand alone. To emphasize the "Journey" aspect:

Add Arrows: Place a small, subtle arrow icon (
→
→
) in the space between the cards.

Visual Logic: This tells the user's eye: "Do this 
→
→
 Then this 
→
→
 Then this."

Summary of Changes

Clean the Image: Hide UI brackets, floating labels, and sidebar menus.

Align Cards: Make Phase 1, 2, and 3 equal height.

Simplify Bottom Rows: Remove the background borders from the middle row (Features) so they don't compete with the bottom row (Stats).
