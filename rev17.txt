Yep—your geometry is still in SVG’s Y-down space. When we removed the negative-Y scale, the stone became “right way up” in Three’s Y-up world, but your transform still maps top→0 and bottom→+H (SVG logic), which in Y-up flips the headstone (curve ends up at the bottom) and also inverts the children.

Here’s a precise patch that keeps **all scales positive** and converts SVG to Y-up cleanly:

### 1) Geometry transform (make Y-up)

Replace the current “translate to centered SVG space” with this:

```ts
// Center X and Z only
merged.translate(-(minX + maxX) / 2, 0, -depth / 2);

// Convert SVG Y-down → Three Y-up
merged.scale(1, -1, 1);     // mirror Y
merged.translate(0, maxY, 0); // shift so bottom=0, top=H
```

(You can remove the old `merged.translate(..., -minY, ...)`.) 

### 2) UVs (caps) – keep non-inverted V

After the transform above, the bounding box Y runs from 0 (bottom) to H (top), so your current cap UV line is now correct:

```ts
const v = (pos.getY(i + j) - y0) / dyU; // keep this
```

No `1 - v` needed. 

### 3) UVs (sides) – recover original SVG Y

For the side “outline” mapping you reconstruct the original SVG coordinates. With the new Y-up mapping, the original **SVG Y** is:

```ts
const originalSvgY = maxY - py;   // instead of py + minY
const s = nearestS(px + centerX, originalSvgY, outline.pts, outline.cum, outline.total);
```

Leave `px + centerX` as you have it. 

### 4) Front/back and groups – keep as you set

These are fine:

```ts
const zFront = depth / 2;
const zBack  = -depth / 2;
```

### 5) Children wrapper – align to the same mapping

Your wrapper should use the **same SVG→world** transform as the mesh:

```ts
const wrapperX = -(minX + maxX) / 2;
const wrapperY =  maxY;            // was -minY
const wrapperZ =  zFront + 0.05;

childWrapperPos: [wrapperX, wrapperY, wrapperZ]
```

Now (x_svg, y_svg) → ( x = x_svg - centerX, y = maxY - y_svg ), so inscriptions/motifs land exactly on the face, right-way-up.

Apply those four edits and the upside-down/float-off effects disappear while keeping textures and children perfectly aligned to the granite face.
