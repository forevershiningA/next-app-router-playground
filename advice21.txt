Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of improvements focusing on User Experience (UX), Visual Design (UI), and Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO).

1. The Biggest Miss: Call to Action (CTA)

The Issue: There is no button to actually start the process. You have "How it works" and a description of the tool, but no way for the user to click and begin.
The Fix:

Add a Primary Button: Place a prominent button (e.g., "Start Designing" or "Try the 3D Studio") under the main paragraph text on the left.

Add a Secondary Button: Consider a secondary CTA under the 3D image, such as "View Example Gallery."

2. Visual Polish of the 3D Render

The Issue: The 3D image looks a bit "gloomy" and dated. The heavy fog and dark lighting make it look like an older video game rather than a peaceful tribute.
The Fix:

Lighting: Brighten the scene. Use a "Golden Hour" (sunset/sunrise) lighting setup. It conveys peace and warmth rather than the cold/spooky vibe of the current fog.

Show the UI: Instead of just showing the stone, show the stone inside a laptop frame or with a cursor hovering over it. This reinforces the idea that this is software they can use, not just a static picture.

3. Text Contrast & Accessibility

The Issue: The target demographic for this service likely includes older adults. Dark mode is elegant, but the grey text on the dark background (specifically in the Phase 1-3 cards and the stats at the bottom) may be hard to read for those with declining vision.
The Fix:

Increase Contrast: Make the body text (currently a medium grey) a much lighter grey or off-white.

Font Size: Bump up the font size of the descriptions inside the Phase cards by 1-2 points.

4. "Phase" Cards Layout

The Issue: The three cards (Phase 1, 2, 3) take up a lot of vertical space and the connection between them is weak. The arrows pointing from one to the next are very faint.
The Fix:

Visual Flow: Make the arrows brighter or distinct to show linear progression.

Simplify Copy: The headlines are good, but the body text is a bit dense. For example, in Phase 1, you list "memorial type, silhouette, stone, balanced proportions." You could simplify this to "Select from 40+ shapes and premium stone materials."

5. Jargon in the Stats Section

The Issue: In the bottom middle card, it says "Slant and Rock Pitch option."
The Fix:

Plain English: Most customers won't know what "Rock Pitch" means. Change this to something more benefit-oriented like "Classic & Modern Styles" or "Customizable Edges & Finishes."

6. Icon Consistency

The Issue: The middle row of icons (Eye, Document, Bookmark) feels like it's floating in no-man's-land.
The Fix:

Alignment: These benefit points ("See every change," "Transparent pricing," etc.) are strong selling points. They should be moved higher up, perhaps right under the main headline/subhead area, or integrated into the Phase cards to explain why that phase is easy.

Summary of Recommended Layout Change:

Headline: (Keep as is)

Subhead: (Keep as is)

NEW BUTTON: [Start Designing Now] (Gold/Bronze color)

Benefits: Move the "Transparent pricing" and "No downloads" icons here.

3D Image: Brighten the lighting, remove the fog.

Process: Keep the 3 steps below, but increase text contrast.
