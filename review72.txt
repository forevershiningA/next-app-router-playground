You’ve got **two different “base renderers” in the file** and only one of them is tied to the fitted stone’s bounds. The other one is a freestanding `<div className="relative">…` that sits **outside the scene container** and sizes itself from `displayWidth/Height` (with a hard `-50px` fudge). That’s why the base keeps “floating”, is too wide, and drifts to the right: it’s not positioned in the same overlay coordinate system as the stone. See the block that starts with:

* `/* Base (pedestal) … positioned directly below headstone */` → `<div className="relative" …>` and widths like
  `width: Math.max(100, (baseData.width || 700) / (shapeData?.width || 600) * scalingFactors.displayWidth - 50)` .

You also still have other earlier/experimental base renderers that compute positions differently (v50/v52/v53/v56/v57/v58), which creates inconsistent sizing and makes debugging hard. Examples: the absolute ones that compute from `topProfile` vs the freestanding `relative` one.

### Solid fix (what to change)

1. **Delete the freestanding “relative” base block(s)** (the whole `<div className="relative" …>` version). Keep only one base renderer that lives **inside the same positioned overlay** as the headstone and computes in **overlay pixels** from `topProfile` + `scalingFactors`. This removes the “floating” and the “too wide” problems. 

2. **Keep exactly one absolute base renderer**, e.g. this version (works cleanly in overlay space and centers + overlaps correctly):

```tsx
{baseData && topProfile && (() => {
  const { uniformScale, initW, initH, offsetX, offsetY } = scalingFactors;
  const overlayW = initW * uniformScale;
  const overlayH = initH * uniformScale;

  // Stone bounds (overlay px) from topProfile
  const sx = overlayW / initW;
  const sy = overlayH / initH;
  const stoneLeft = offsetX + topProfile.offX * sx;
  const stoneTop  = offsetY + (topProfile.offY ?? 0) * sy;
  const stoneW    = topProfile.drawW * sx;
  const stoneH    = topProfile.drawH * sy;
  const stoneBottom = stoneTop + stoneH;

  // Base geometry
  const baseOverhang = 0.04;                // ~4% wider than tablet
  const baseWidth  = Math.round(stoneW * (1 + baseOverhang));
  const baseHeight = Math.round(overlayH * 0.085);   // ~8.5% of canvas height
  const overlapPx  = Math.round(baseHeight * 0.25);  // tuck under tablet by 25%

  // Center horizontally; overlap upward into the stone
  let baseLeft = Math.round(stoneLeft + (stoneW - baseWidth) / 2);
  let baseTop  = Math.round(stoneBottom - overlapPx);

  // Clamp inside overlay
  baseLeft = Math.max(0, Math.min(overlayW - baseWidth, baseLeft));
  baseTop  = Math.max(offsetY, Math.min(offsetY + overlayH - baseHeight, baseTop));

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        left: baseLeft,
        top: baseTop,
        width: baseWidth,
        height: baseHeight,
        transform: 'none',                    // IMPORTANT: no translate that would break centering
        backgroundImage: baseTextureData ? `url(${baseTextureData})`
                                         : 'linear-gradient(to bottom, #1a1a1a, #000)',
        backgroundSize: 'cover',
        backgroundPosition: 'center',
        boxShadow: '0 4px 6px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 2px 4px -2px rgb(0 0 0 / .1)',
        zIndex: 3
      }}
    />
  );
})}
```

This is essentially your best “absolute” variant, cleaned and unified (no `-50px` fudge, no display-space sizing, no stray transforms). It’s the same approach as your good “v58 overlay”/“v53” blocks, just consolidated so there’s only one source of truth.

3. **Ensure the parent overlay container is `position: relative;`** (it already is in your scene container). That’s required so the base’s `position: absolute` coordinates align with the headstone.

4. **Remove all the duplicate/older base sections** (v50/52/53/56/57/58 and the `relative` block). Having multiple versions in the tree can also cause unexpected stacking, misalignment, and “still the same” impressions while you’re editing.

### Why this fixes your screenshots

* The base is drawn **in the same coordinate system** as the stone (overlay pixels), so its width equals “stone width ± overhang” and its **center lines up with the stone**. No more “too wide” or “too far right”.
* Using `stoneBottom - overlapPx` keeps it **tucked under** the tablet instead of floating.
* Clamping to the overlay bounds ensures the base never drops below the canvas (your “base moved to the bottom” image came from the freestanding block that wasn’t tied to the overlay at all). 

If you want me to mark the exact lines to delete in your file, send me the current `DesignPageClient.tsx` again and I’ll return a minimal diff.
