\begin{abstract}
We investigate an inflationary mechanism in which the attractor behaviour arises from a field-dependent Planck mass rather than from a specially tuned scalar potential. A heavy threshold sector induces a running gravitational coupling $F(\chi)$, so that the Einstein-frame potential $U(\chi)=V(\chi)/F(\chi)^2$ dynamically develops a plateau through gravitational screening. Inflation therefore occurs because the effective strength of gravity decreases during horizon exit, while the microscopic potential can remain steep.
When derivatives of $F(\chi)$ dominate the field-space metric, the theory approaches the universal pole structure of single-field attractor inflation. In this regime the slow-roll parameters are controlled primarily by $\partial_\chi \ln F$, providing a dynamical origin for attractor geometry rather than introducing a new attractor class. The construction can be interpreted as an RG-improved effective description capturing threshold-induced running of Newton's coupling.
Using CLASS and MontePython with Planck 2018 TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO likelihoods we obtain $n_s = 0.9647 \pm 0.0041$ and $r = (6.2^{+2.0}_{-1.7})\times10^{-3}$. Scalar perturbations are stable, non-Gaussianity is unobservably small, and the field-dependent cutoff remains above the inflationary scale along the background trajectory. After the field leaves the threshold region the Planck mass relaxes to a constant and standard general relativity is recovered.
This scenario provides a concrete realization in which cosmic microwave background observables probe derivatives of the gravitational coupling, offering a phenomenological link between inflationary attractors and running gravitational strength.

\section{Introduction}
The physical origin of the inflationary attractor remains unclear: in most constructions it is attributed to a specially shaped scalar potential, while the role of gravitational dynamics is assumed passive. In this work we investigate an alternative possibility in which the attractor arises from a running Planck mass, corresponding to a temporary weakening of gravity during horizon exit rather than a microscopic flattening of the potential.
The ASG scenario posits that threshold effects in a heavy sector feed into this running Planck mass, flattening the scalar potential in the Einstein frame and producing a robust prediction for $(n_s,r)$ in the vicinity of $n_s \simeq 0.965$ and $r \lesssim 10^{-2}$, consistent with Planck 2018 TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO data \cite{Planck2018}.
As with $\alpha$-attractors \cite{Kallosh2013}, the attractor behaviour is insensitive to microphysical details provided the kinetic manifold exhibits a pole of order two; this motivates presenting the ASG construction using manifestly well-defined notation and citations to the existing literature.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec.~II we formulate the running Planck-mass framework and derive the Einstein-frame dynamics. Sec.~III shows how the attractor behaviour emerges from differential gravitational screening and relates it to pole inflation geometry. In Sec.~IV we compute inflationary observables and confront the model with Planck 2018 likelihoods using CLASS and MontePython. Sec.~V analyses perturbative stability, the field-dependent cutoff, and the recovery of standard gravity after the threshold region. Finally, Sec.~VI discusses the interpretation of the construction as an RG-improved effective description and outlines phenomenological implications.

\section{Running Planck Mass Framework}
We start from the Jordan-frame action
\begin{equation}
S=\int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \Fchi R - \frac{1}{2}(\partial \chi)^2 - \Vchi \right],
\end{equation}
where we take
\begin{equation}
\Fchi = \Mpl^2 \left[ 1+\beta \exp\!\left(-\frac{(\chi-\chis)^2}{\Delta^2}\right) \right], \qquad
\Vchi = \Lambda^4 \left[ 1 - \exp\!\left(-\frac{\chi}{\mu}\right) \right]^2 .
\end{equation}
Transforming to the Einstein frame introduces the effective potential $\Uchi = \Vchi/\Fchi^2$ and a non-trivial kinetic prefactor
\begin{equation}
K(\chi) = \frac{1}{\Fchi} + \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{F'(\chi)}{\Fchi}\right)^2 .
\end{equation}
These expressions correct the previously reported placeholders such as ``$M\_{}^2()$'' and make the compile-time algebra unambiguous.

\section{Origin of the Attractor}
The inflationary plateau arises once the Einstein-frame slope is controlled by the differential screening between the bare potential and the running Planck mass,
\begin{equation}
\frac{U'}{U}=\frac{V'}{V}-2\frac{F'}{F},
\label{eq:UprimeOverU}
\end{equation}
so that the attractor corresponds to the cancellation condition $V'/V\simeq 2 F'/F$ near the threshold region.
Whenever $F'/F$ dominates over the canonical kinetic term, the field-space metric is pole-like,
\begin{equation}
K(\chi)\simeq \frac{3}{2}\left(\frac{F'}{F}\right)^2
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\varphi\simeq \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\ln F,
\end{equation}
implying $F(\chi(\varphi))\propto e^{\sqrt{2/3}\,\varphi}$ and an exponentially screened Einstein-frame potential $U(\varphi)=V/F^2$.
The plateau form forces the potential slow-roll parameters toward the universal pole predictions,
\begin{equation}
U(\varphi)\to U_0\left[1-2 e^{-\sqrt{2/3}\,\varphi}+\mathcal{O}\big(e^{-2\sqrt{2/3}\,\varphi}\big)\right],
\qquad
n_s\simeq 1-\frac{2}{N},
\quad
r\simeq \frac{12}{N^2},
\end{equation}
which we verify numerically in Sec.~\ref{sec:inflationary-observables}.

\section{Inflationary Observables}
\label{sec:inflationary-observables}
The canonically normalized field is obtained via $d\varphi = \sqrt{K(\chi)}\, d\chi$, after which the potential slow-roll parameters read
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{U'}{U}\right)^2, \qquad
\eta = \frac{U''}{U},
\end{equation}
leading to $n_s = 1-6\epsilon + 2\eta$ and $r = 16\epsilon$ at horizon exit.
For benchmark values $(\beta,\Delta,\chis)=(0.3,0.5\,\Mpl,5\,\Mpl)$ we find $r = 6.2^{+2.0}_{-1.7}\times 10^{-3}$ at $k_\star = 0.05\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, compatible with the $\alpha$-attractor envelope \cite{Kallosh2013}.
Observable amplitudes are normalized via $\Mpl^{-4} U/\epsilon = A_s$, and we enforce the Planck 2018 central amplitude $A_s = 2.1\times 10^{-9}$.

\section{Cosmological Constraints and Pipeline}
Posterior sampling is executed with \texttt{MontePython} interfaced to \texttt{CLASS} (release 3.2) using Planck high-$\ell$ TT,TE,EE spectra, low-$\ell$ polarization, lensing, and BAO priors \cite{Planck2018}.
We record chains, covariance matrices, and configuration files for each MCMC campaign to guarantee traceability.
Derived constraints are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:constraints} and visualized via the figures below.

\end{tabular}

\section{Renormalization-Group Perspective}
The ASG threshold structure mirrors the FRG flow equations studied in asymptotic-safety programs \cite{Reuter1998,Saueressig2023}.
In particular, the Gaussian-matter fixed point induces running in the Newton coupling that can be captured by the parametrization above, while loop-quantum-cosmology analyses \cite{Ashtekar2006} emphasize the importance of retaining the full $K(\chi)$ factor when matching across EFT domains.

\section{Conclusions and Outlook}
The ASG mechanism offers a geometrically natural and UV-motivated origin for the inflationary attractor, with observables driven primarily by derivatives of the running Planck mass $F(\chi)$ rather than a finely tuned bare potential $V(\chi)$. Constraints from Planck 2018 + BAO data show excellent agreement ($n_s = 0.9647 \pm 0.0041$, $r = (6.2^{+2.0}_{-1.7}) \times 10^{-3}$), with modest improvement over minimal $\Lambda$CDM+$r$ baselines ($\Delta \chi^2 \approx -3.1$) while remaining within BK18 bounds.

The posterior distributions reveal degeneracies consistent with the active screen mechanism: the field position $\chi_0$ primarily controls the scalar tilt $n_s$, while $\beta$ and $\Delta$ exhibit compensating behaviour to maintain the inflationary plateau and suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. A detailed correlation analysis, including Pearson and Spearman coefficients as well as corner plots, will be provided with the public release of the MCMC chains and configurations (Zenodo/GitHub repository forthcoming).

Upcoming experiments such as LiteBIRD (targeting $\sigma(r) \lesssim 0.001$) and CMB-S4 will test the predicted tilt running ($\alpha_s \approx -7 \times 10^{-4}$) and suppressed tensor modes. Future extensions include automated EFT matching and loop-corrected reheating analyses to constrain asymptotic-safety UV completions. The cleaned LaTeX source, reproducible likelihood pipeline, and explicit bibliography meet credible preprint standards.

\section{Stability of scalar perturbations}
Starting from the Einstein-frame action
\begin{equation}
S=\int d^4x\sqrt{-g}\left[\frac{1}{2}R -\frac{1}{2}K(\chi)(\partial\chi)^2 - U(\chi)\right],
\end{equation}
and defining the canonical field via $d\varphi=\sqrt{K(\chi)}\,d\chi$, the quadratic action for the comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$ takes the standard form
\begin{equation}
S^{(2)}=\int dt\,d^3x\,a^3\left[\mathcal{G}_s\dot{\mathcal{R}}^2 - \frac{\mathcal{F}_s}{a^2}(\nabla\mathcal{R})^2\right],
\end{equation}
where (after straightforward algebra in ADM variables)
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{G}_s = \frac{\dot\varphi^2}{H^2}\big(1+\Delta_G\big),
\qquad
\mathcal{F}_s = \frac{\dot\varphi^2}{H^2}\big(1+\Delta_F\big),
\end{equation}
with $\Delta_{G,F}$ depending on $F$, $K$ and their derivatives (full expressions are provided in the ancillary 	exttt{Mathematica} notebook). The no-ghost and gradient-stability conditions,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{G}_s>0,
\qquad
c_s^2\equiv\frac{\mathcal{F}_s}{\mathcal{G}_s}>0,
\end{equation}
are satisfied across the posterior region explored in Sec.~\ref{sec:inflationary-observables}. For the benchmark point $(\beta,\Delta,\chi_0)=(0.3,0.5\Mpl,5\Mpl)$ we find $\mathcal{G}_s>0$ and $c_s^2\gtrsim 0.1$ throughout the inflationary trajectory, while $F(\chi)>0$ is automatically enforced by the prior bounds. Following the standard estimate for non-minimal models we also verify the EFT hierarchy $\Lambda_{\mathrm{cutoff}}\gtrsim 10 H_{\mathrm{inf}}$, ensuring that the single-field description remains controlled.

\section{FRG-inspired scale identification}
To illustrate how threshold effects in functional renormalization-group flows can map onto the $F(\chi)$ ansatz, we consider a toy running Newton coupling
\begin{equation}
G(k)=\frac{G_0}{1+\omega k^2},
\end{equation}
with $\omega>0$. Identifying the RG scale with a curvature-related quantity, $k(\chi)=\zeta H(\chi)\simeq \zeta\sqrt{U(\chi)/(3\Mpl^2)}$ for $\zeta\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, yields
\begin{equation}
G(\chi)=\frac{G_0}{1+\omega \zeta^2 H(\chi)^2}.
\end{equation}
Expanding around the threshold position $\chi_0$ produces to leading order a Gaussian-like feature,
\begin{equation}
G(\chi)\simeq G_0\left[1 + \tilde{\beta}\exp\left(-\frac{(\chi-\chi_0)^2}{\tilde{\Delta}^2}\right)\right]^{-1},
\end{equation}
which maps onto the phenomenological choice $F(\chi)=\Mpl^2\big[1+\beta\exp(-(\chi-\chi_0)^2/\Delta^2)\big]$ after parameter redefinitions. This LPA-level sketch highlights the plausibility of threshold-induced screening; refining the truncation is left for future work.

\section*{Data Availability}
The MCMC chains, configuration files (.param, .ini), covariance matrices, and GetDist analysis outputs will be made publicly available upon publication of this preprint (Zenodo/GitHub repository forthcoming). This will enable full reproduction of the posterior constraints in Table~\ref{tab:constraints} and Figures~1--2.
