Good news: you’re back to a “visible + predictable” version. The reason it’s **still not centred** is now very specific and easy to fix.

Also quick note: I got a system notice that **some of your previously uploaded files have expired**, so if you want me to inspect any other files again later, you may need to re-upload them. The current `/mnt/data/AdditionModel.tsx` is available and that’s what I’m referencing here.

# What’s causing the statue to not be centred (in your current `AdditionModel.tsx`)

There are **two separate “not centred” behaviours** happening:

## A) Depth (Z) is being offset twice

In your file:

* `baseSurfaceZ` is computed using the base **top centre** point (local z=0):

  ```ts
  const topPoint = new THREE.Vector3(0, targetBBox.max.y, 0);
  ...
  return stone.worldToLocal(worldTop.clone()).z;
  ```

  So **baseSurfaceZ already represents the base depth-centre** (in headstone space).

But then you do, for statues/vases:

```ts
zPosition = surfaceZ + actualDepth / 2;
```

…and then you also do this hack:

```ts
zPosition + (prefersBaseSurface ? -0.15 : 0)
```

So the statue gets pushed forward by `actualDepth/2`, then shoved back by 150mm, which will *never* be “centred”.

✅ **Fix:** if your `baseSurfaceZ` is the base depth centre, then statues/vases should use:

```ts
zPosition = surfaceZ;
```

…and you should remove the `-0.15` hack.

## B) X is clamping to the edge because your statue xOffset is negative

In the base placement default:

```ts
if (addition.type === 'statue') {
  targetX = minX + posConfig.xOffset;
}
targetX = clamp(minX..maxX, targetX);
```

Your statue xOffset is currently:

```ts
statue: { xOffset: -80 * MM }
```

So:

* `minX + (-0.08)` is **outside the allowed range**
* clamp snaps it back to **minX**
* result: statue sits hard on the left edge, not nicely centred/inset.

✅ **Fix:** treat statue offset as an **inset from the left edge**, not “left of something”, so make it **positive**.

# The exact code changes to make it centred

## 1) Fix Z centring (recommended “do this first”)

In the Z calculation block around line ~647:

**Change this:**

```ts
} else {
  // For statues and vases, center them on the surface depth-wise
  zPosition = surfaceZ + actualDepth / 2;
}
```

**To this:**

```ts
} else {
  // For statues and vases on base, baseSurfaceZ is already the base depth-centre
  zPosition = surfaceZ;
}
```

Now remove the extra shove-back in the group position:

**Change this:**

```ts
zPosition + (prefersBaseSurface ? -0.15 : 0)
```

**To this:**

```ts
zPosition
```

That will make the statue sit centred front-to-back on the base.

---

## 2) Fix X “centred on the base end” (stop edge-clamping)

Update the default statue xOffset:

```ts
statue: {
  xOffset: 80 * MM,   // ✅ 80mm inset from left edge (NOT negative)
  yOffset: 0,
},
vase: {
  xOffset: -30 * MM,  // ✅ 30mm inset from right edge (keep negative here)
  yOffset: 0,
},
```

Why vase stays negative: you place vases using `maxX + xOffset`, so negative moves inward.

# If you want “true centring” (statue centred in the left extension area)

Right now you’re anchoring relative to the base edge. If you mean “centre the statue on the *extra base length* to the left of the headstone”, then we need one more step:

* compute headstone footprint X in base space
* compute the left-extension span = `[base.minX .. headstone.minX]`
* place statue at the middle of that span

If that’s what you mean by centred, tell me which is correct:

1. **Inset from base end** (simple, looks like your screenshot intent)
2. **Centred in the left extension area** (more “designed” placement)

Either way, do the Z fix above first — that’s the one making it look “off” even when X is right.
