This iteration is getting closer, but there is one major visual error that is currently breaking the realism entirely: The top of the base.

Here is exactly what is wrong and how to fix it in Three.js or your modeling software.

1. The "White Base" Problem (Critical)

The Issue: Look at the top surface of the bottom pedestal. It is bright white and lacks detail, while the front face of that same pedestal is dark granite.

Why is this happening? This is almost certainly a UV Mapping scale issue. The texture is zoomed in so close on that top face that you are seeing just a tiny, blurry patch of a light-colored grain, making the whole surface look white.

The Fix: You need to scale the UVs for that top face down significantly so the grain size matches the front face.

If editing in 3D software: Select that top face and scale up the UV island until the checkerboard size matches the front.

If editing in Three.js code: If the base is a separate mesh from the headstone, you can try increasing the texture repeat:

code

expand_less
baseTexture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
baseTexture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
baseTexture.repeat.set(4, 4); // Increase this number until the grain looks small
2. The "Smeared" Top Edge

The Issue: Look at the curved top surface of the headstone. The granite texture is streaked horizontally.

Why: The UV map for that strip is being projected from the front, meaning the texture is being stretched across the depth.

The Fix: This requires a 3D modeling fix. That top strip needs to be UV unwrapped separately so it lays flat on the texture image.

3. Lighting & Gloss (The "Wet" Look)

The Issue: The stone looks dry and dusty. Polished granite acts almost like a mirror.
The Fix: You need to tighten the material settings in Three.js to make it look like a hard, polished stone.

Use this setup for your material:

code
JavaScript
download
content_copy
expand_less
const graniteMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    map: textureLoader.load('granite_diffuse.jpg'),
    color: 0x888888, // Slightly darken the base color to make reflections pop
    
    roughness: 0.15, // Low roughness = High Gloss
    metalness: 0.0,  // Stone is not metal
    
    envMap: scene.environment, // You MUST have an HDRI loaded for this to work
    envMapIntensity: 1.5
});

Note: If you are using MeshPhysicalMaterial, add clearcoat: 1.0 and clearcoatRoughness: 0.1.

Summary Checklist for Next Version:

Fix the Base Top: It must match the color and grain size of the front. Currently, it looks like white plaster on top of dark stone.

Fix Top Edge UVs: Stop the streaking texture on the curve.

Add HDRI: The gold and stone look flat because they aren't reflecting a world. Load an environment map (even a simple studio lighting HDRI) to give the gold its metallic shine.
