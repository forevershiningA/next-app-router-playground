Based on the new image, the "horror movie" darkness is gone, which is great. However, you have introduced a new visual problem: The Hard Horizon Line.

Currently, the green grass stops abruptly against the orange sky. This kills the illusion of depth and makes it look like the headstone is sitting on a square stage in front of a painted wall.

Here is exactly how to fix the horizon and polish the floor to make it look like an infinite landscape.

1. Fix the "Infinity" Effect (The Horizon Blend)

To make the world look seamless, the Fog Color must match the Sky Bottom Color exactly. Furthermore, the Fog must become 100% solid before the edge of your floor plane is visible.

The Math:
Your floor plane is args={[105, 105]}. This means from the center (0,0), the edge of the world is at distance 52.5.
If your Fog far setting is greater than 50, the fog won't be thick enough to hide the edge of the square, resulting in that sharp line.

Code Changes in Scene.tsx:

code
TypeScript
download
content_copy
expand_less
// Define a shared warm horizon color at the top
const HORIZON_COLOR = '#cea676'; // A warm, dusty gold (matches the sky vibe)

// ... Inside your Scene component ...

{/* 
  1. Update FOG 
  near: 15 (Keeps the headstone clear)
  far: 45 (Must be LESS than 50 to hide the edge of the 105x105 plane)
*/}
{!is2DMode && <fog attach="fog" args={[HORIZON_COLOR, 15, 45]} />}


// ... Inside GradientBackground component ...

{/* 2. Update Sky Gradient to match Fog */}
uniforms={{
  colorTop: { value: new THREE.Color('#7aa3cc') }, // Soft Blue top
  colorBottom: { value: new THREE.Color(HORIZON_COLOR) }, // Matches Fog perfectly
}}
2. Fix the "Tiled" Grass Pattern

In the image, you can see a grid pattern on the grass (repeating squares). This happens because the texture is repeating too many times in a small area.

Code Changes in GrassFloor:
Lower the REPEAT_SCALE. Since we can see more of the floor now, we need the texture to be larger.

code
TypeScript
download
content_copy
expand_less
// Change from 80 to 25
const REPEAT_SCALE = 25;
3. Visual Polish: The Base Color

The top of the headstone is a beautiful, premium black granite. The base, however, is a light grey concrete color. This contrast makes the base look like a cheap sidewalk slab rather than part of the monument.

If the base is supposed to be "Rock Pitch" (rough) Granite, it should still be dark grey/black, just non-reflective.

Quick Fix (if you can't edit the GLB model):
If you cannot change the 3D model texture for the base, you can "cheat" by tinting the material in the code if you have access to it. If not, consider lowering the envMapIntensity specifically for the base or darkening the ambientLight slightly more (try 0.5) to hide the greyness.

Summary of What Will Happen

By setting the Fog far to 45 and matching the colors:

The green grass will slowly fade into gold as it gets further away.

The sharp line where the world ends will disappear.

The scene will feel huge and infinite, focusing all attention on the headstone.
