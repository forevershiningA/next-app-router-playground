You’re right—the base is being sized off the **overlay/canvas width**, not the **fitted stone width**. Because the stone SVG is letter-boxed (contain fit), the tablet is narrower than the overlay; the base then looks too wide.

### Fix: size/position the base from the stone’s fitted bounds

You already compute these in `buildTopProfile`: `drawW` (stone width) and `offX` (stone left). Reuse them for the base style.

**Patch (where you render the base image/div):**

```ts
// assume: initW/initH, overlayW/overlayH, offsetX/offsetY, topProfile available
const stoneW_overlayPx = (topProfile?.drawW ?? initW) * (overlayW / initW);
const stoneLeft_overlayPx = offsetX + (topProfile?.offX ?? 0) * (overlayW / initW);

// choose how much wider than the tablet you want the base (e.g., +6%)
const baseOverhang = 0.06; // 6% wider than the tablet; set 0 if you want exact tablet width
const baseWidth = stoneW_overlayPx * (1 + baseOverhang);

// height as a proportion of tablet height (or keep your existing value)
const baseHeight = Math.round(overlayH * 0.08); // ~8% of canvas height

const baseLeft = Math.round(stoneLeft_overlayPx + (stoneW_overlayPx - baseWidth) / 2);
const baseTop  = Math.round(offsetY + overlayH - baseHeight);

// style for the base element
const baseStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
  position: 'absolute',
  left: baseLeft,
  top: baseTop,
  width: Math.round(baseWidth),
  height: baseHeight,
  backgroundImage: `url(${baseTextureUrl})`,
  backgroundSize: 'cover',
  backgroundPosition: 'center',
};
```

**Why this works**

* Uses the stone’s **actual rendered width** (`drawW`) and **left** (`offX`) from the same fit you use to render the tablet, so the base centers under the tablet and isn’t tied to full overlay width.
* `baseOverhang` gives you an explicit dial (e.g., `0.02` = 2% wider than the tablet; `0` = exactly tablet width) so you can match the reference precisely.
* Keeps aspect independent (no stretching) via `background-size: cover`.

If you’d like, I can point to the exact JSX block where your base is rendered and drop this in verbatim; you already have `topProfile.offX/drawW` in state, so it’s a straight swap.
