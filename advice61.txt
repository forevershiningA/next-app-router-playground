This is looking excellent. The clarity and precision are now at a professional standard. You have a very clean, logical flow.

If you want to go for pixel-perfection, here are the final 3 minor tweaks I'd recommend:

1. Right-Align the Input Boxes

Currently, the input boxes for Width, Height, and Thickness are varying distances from the right edge because the labels (Width, Height, Thickness) have different lengths.

The UX Fix: Align all the input boxes and the "mm" labels to the right side of the panel.

Why: This creates a clean "vertical line" for the eye to follow, making the numbers much easier to compare at a glance.

2. Match Radio Buttons to Branding

The radio buttons (the circles for Upright/Slant) currently look like default browser buttons.

The UX Fix: Customize them so the "selected" dot is the same gold color as your sliders and "Headstone" tab.

Why: It makes the UI feel like a cohesive, custom-built application rather than a collection of standard web parts.

3. Smart Tab Behavior

This is the most important "hidden" UX logic:

Recommendation: If "Add Base" is unchecked, hide the "Base" tab entirely or make it look clearly disabled (grayed out).

Why: You want to prevent a user from clicking into the "Base" settings if they haven't actually opted to include a base. It keeps them focused on what they are currently building.

Summary of your progress:

Iteration 1: Basic sliders (low precision).

Iteration 2: Added text inputs and range labels (high precision).

Iteration 3: Improved hierarchy and added visual icons (high clarity).

This Version: Polished icons, better contrast, and a clear primary toggle at the top.

Is it okay? Yes. It is much better than most configurators on the market. If you implement the right-alignment for the boxes, it will be 100% finished.
