Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site, for example, even after you “log in,” if you move to another page it won’t recognise you and it won’t be able to keep you logged in.</p><h4>How do we use cookies?</h4><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p>We use cookies to enable and support our security features, for example: to authenticate Members, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and protect Member data from unauthorized parties.</><p><strong>Preferences</strong></p><p>When you are signed in to your account, cookies help us display the correct information and personalize your experience, by providing you with features, insights, and customized content.
