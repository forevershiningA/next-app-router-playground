Her name was Rebecca Nurse, they say, A gentle soul, with eyes of gray.  A beacon of kindness, her heart did shine, A calming presence, in troubled times. With wisdom beyond her earthly years, She soothed the pain and eased the fears.  But whispers spread around the town, Accusations that shook it to the ground. The witch-hunt frenzy, it took its toll, Innocent lives condemned to pay the toll.  Rebecca Nurse, a victim of lies, Accused of witchcraft, she stood defied. Her faith unwavering as the trials unfurled, A woman of strength, in this surreal world.  With courage she faced the judge and the jury, For truth and justice, she fought with fury. Her spirit unbroken, her voice so clear, She demanded her innocence be kept near.  But despite her pleas and fervent cries, She was condemned to meet her demise. The gallows stood tall, a haunt in the air, As a crowd gathered to witness despair.  On that fateful day, as the rope was tied, Rebecca Nurse stood tall, unafraid to die. With grace and dignity, she faced her fate, A martyr for justice, she became the bait.  Her name forever etched in our hearts, Rebecca Nurse, torn apart by dark arts. May her memory inspire us today, To stand against injustice, come what may.  In every soul, let her spirit reside, A symbol of love and strength, side by side. Rebecca Nurse, though long gone from sight, Her legacy of resilience shines in the night.","font":"88.15030933633297px Garamond","font_size":50,"font_family":"Garamond","color":"#ffffff","colorName":"White","x":0,"y":0,"rotation":0,"flipx":1,"flipy":1,"height":50,"itemID":4},{"productid":"16","name":"Black Granite Inscription (free)","type":"Inscription","part":"Headstone","side":"Front","price":0,"quantity":58,"label":"In the village where secrets brew, There lived a woman, dear and true.","font":"31.73411136107987px Garamond","font_size":18,"font_family":"Garamond","color":"#ffffff","colorName":"White","x":-2,"y":-146,"rotation":0,"flipx":1,"flipy":1,"height":19,"itemID":5}]
