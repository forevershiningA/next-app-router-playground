But where hearts are true & faithful, love abides, and never grows old. Time can bring no vain regrets, nor take away from me, the golden music of the years ,the echo of sweet memory. for I believe in life immortal and loves eternal bond. I shall find my dear companion with Jesus in the great beyond ,we were two hearts beating as one Amen Traveling on with Jesus Gone But Never Forgotten By Us Son Mark & Family Daughters Julie , Tina"
