When you awake in the morning hush, I\u2019m the swift, uplifting rush\u2026 Of quiet birds in circling flight. I\u2019m the sunshine in your hair I\u2019m the shadow on the ground I\u2019m the whisper in the wind I\u2019m your imaginary friend And I know I\u2019m in your prayers; And you know that you\u2019re in mine. So, Don\u2019t stand at my grave and cry. I\u2019m the thousand winds that blow. I am not here. Don\u2019t stand at my grave and cry, I\u2019ve gone ahead to be with Jesus, So be sure to get here when it\u2019s your time. Oh, What a Happy Day that will be, when we all See Jesus, Together again. God Bless You All. Because you know that I\u2019m not here. Children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man;  so are children of the youth. 5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed,  but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. - Psalm 127:3-5"
