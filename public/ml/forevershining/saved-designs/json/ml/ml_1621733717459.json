We lived with the specter of death for such a long time, and you confounded death, (and doctors) with your strength and spirit. But now your race is run, and ours has just begun. There was nothing left unsaid between us, we loved deeply, but I wish I had loved you more. I wish so much to be with you, but you told me I had to stay behind and live my life. I know time will help, but the huge hole in my heart can only ever partly heal. We all have such wonderful memories to give us strength and to keep your spirit alive. Tom\" She radiated Love and Friendship Until we meet again Loving Wife of Tom Mother of Tracey, Michelle, Amy and Kristy"
