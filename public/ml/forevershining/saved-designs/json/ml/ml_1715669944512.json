Not by the things you say and do, But by everything that makes you, you. What words can be spoken to mend my heart? Now that we are forever apart. There are no words that can stop these tears, Like watching the sun as it disappears. Words can be spoken, written and sung, And you will always be forever young. May it be known that you are in our hearts, While we watch the ship as it departs. You are now dancing with angels above. Peaceful and free with so much love. I do not wish to say the word goodbye, For I will miss you too much I will not lie. There are no words that one can say, To ease the pain and make it go away. Instead you will live forever in my heart and mind. Go forth and shine and leave us behind. I will search for you in rainbows and stars, You will be the brightest one by far.\" \"How much do you really mean to  me? By Todd Lynch Blue Tree Project"
