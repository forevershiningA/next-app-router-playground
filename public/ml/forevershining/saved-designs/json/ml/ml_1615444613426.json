A garden of the heart; They planted all the good things, That gave our lives a start They turned us to the sunshine, And encouraged us to dream: Fostering and nurturing seeds of self-esteem. And when the winds and rain came, They protected us enough; But not too much because they knew We would stand up strong and tough."
