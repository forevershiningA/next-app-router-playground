Hard working hands at rest, your heart was in the land, You gave your all to those around you, when love was in demand. Having you in our lives, we\u2019ve all been greatly blessed, But now the time has arrived, for you to be at rest. Your memory now our keepsake, which we\u2019ll never part, God has you in his keeping, we have you in our heart. MUCHED LOVED FATHER IN LAW TO MICHAEL AND MARIA ADORED GRANDFATHER OF CAITLIN AND THOMAS LOVING HUSBAND OF ANN, CHERISHED FARTHER OF ROGER AND TRINA"
