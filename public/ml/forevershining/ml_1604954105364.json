My angel up in heaven, I wanted you to know I wish you were with me, but that can never be, Memories of you in my heart, that only I can see. My angel up in heaven, I hope you understand, That I would give anything, if I could hold your hand. I'd hold you oh so tightly, and never let you go, And all the love inside of me, to you I would show. My angel up in heaven, for now we are apart, Forever my Angel Helen Mary Johnson 19.04.1941 - 12.05.2018 You'll always live inside of me, deep within my heart. \"Little Mummy\""
