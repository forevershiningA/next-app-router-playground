He refreshes and restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and your staff they comfort and console me.  You prepare a table before me in the in the presence of my enemies.  You have anointed and refreshed my head with oil; my cup overflows.  Surely goodness and mercy and unfailing love shall follow me all the days of my life. And I shall dwell forever in the house and in the presence of the the Lord.
