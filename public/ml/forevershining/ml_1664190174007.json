We think about you in silence, We often speak your name. Now all we have is memories, And your picture in a frame. Your memory is our keepsake, With which we will never part. God has you in his keeping, We have you in our hearts. Born 05th July 1996 Sadly taken from us 11th May 2022 In loving memory of our beautiful daughter"
