I&amp;apos;ll tell you one fuckin&amp;apos; thing, I hope we get fuckin&amp;apos; hotter than shit, just to stuff it up them 3,000 fuckin&amp;apos; people that show up every fuckin&amp;apos; day, because if they&amp;apos;re the real Chicago fuckin&amp;apos; fans, they can kiss my fuckin&amp;apos; ass right downtown and PRINT IT.  "They&amp;apos;re really, really behind you around here... my fuckin&amp;apos; ass. What the fuck am I supposed to do, go out there and let my fuckin&amp;apos; players get destroyed every day and be quiet about it? For the fuckin&amp;apos; nickel-dime people who turn up? The motherfuckers don&amp;apos;t even work. That&amp;apos;s why they&amp;apos;re out at the fuckin&amp;apos; game. They oughta go out and get a fuckin&amp;apos; job and find out what it&amp;apos;s like to go out and earn a fuckin&amp;apos; living. Eighty-five percent of the fuckin&amp;apos; world is working. The other fifteen percent come out here. A fuckin&amp;apos; playground for the cocksuckers. Rip them motherfuckers. Rip them fuckin&amp;apos; cocksuckers like the fuckin&amp;apos; players. we got guys bustin&amp;apos; their fuckin&amp;apos; ass, and them fuckin&amp;apos; people boo. And that&amp;apos;s the Cubs? My players get around here. I haven&amp;apos;t seen it this fuckin&amp;apos; year. Everybody associated with this organization have been winners their whole fuckin&amp;apos; life. Everybody. And the credit is not given in that respect.  "Alright, they don&amp;apos;t show because we&amp;apos;re 5 and 14... and unfortunately, that&amp;apos;s the criteria of them dumb 15 motherfuckin&amp;apos; percent that come out to day baseball. The other 85 percent are earning a living. I tell you, it&amp;apos;ll take more than a 5 and 12 or 5 and 14 to destroy the makeup of this club. I guarantee you that. There&amp;apos;s some fuckin&amp;apos; pros out there that wanna win. But you&amp;apos;re stuck in a fuckin&amp;apos; stigma of the fuckin&amp;apos; Dodgers and the Phillies and the Cardinals and all that cheap shit. It&amp;apos;s unbelievable. It really is. It&amp;apos;s a disheartening fuckin&amp;apos; situation that we&amp;apos;re in right now. Anybody who was associated with the Cub organization four or five years ago that came back and sees the multitude of progress that&amp;apos;s been made will understand that if they&amp;apos;re baseball people, that 5 and 14 doesn&amp;apos;t negate all that work. We got 143 fuckin&amp;apos; games left.  "What I&amp;apos;m tryin&amp;apos; to say is don&amp;apos;t rip them fuckin&amp;apos; guys out there. Rip me. If you wanna rip somebody, rip my fuckin&amp;apos; ass. But don&amp;apos;t rip them fuckin&amp;apos; guys &amp;apos;cause they&amp;apos;re givin&amp;apos; everything they can give. And right now they&amp;apos;re tryin&amp;apos; to do more than God gave &amp;apos;em, and that&amp;apos;s why we make the simple mistakes. That&amp;apos;s exactly why." -Lee Elia, April 29, 1983</label><font type="string">32.266347141389936px Garamond</font><font_size type="number">20</font_size><font_family type="string">Garamond</font_family><color type="string">#ffb35a</color><colorName type="string">Paint Fill</colorName><x type="number">0</x><y type="number">0</y><rotation type="number">0</rotation><flipx type="number">1</flipx><flipy type="number">1</flipy><height type="number">20</height><itemID type="number">2</itemID></item></dyo>
