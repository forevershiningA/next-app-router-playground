It is native to Australia and the Aboriginal people have and still use it for many things. One of the most common use for the Paper Bark tree is bandages.  The bark off of the tree contains many good things in it, such as an ointment that soothes, heals and helps the wound, it also stops the bleeding.  It is very soft, comfortable and protects the wound from anything getting in it.   As the bark is really soft and comfortable, and the Aboriginal people would use it for beds and for babies to lay on.  They would also soak it in water than rap their food in it such as fish and red meat, they would then put it on the fire.  It was used like tinfoil, as back then the Aboriginals did not have tinfoil.   Another use for the paper bark tree is that the bark is water proof, so the Aboriginals would use it to put inside their boats to stop the water from coming in, they would also use it for their camp huts to stop rain and other things falling inside. The leaves on the paper bark tree are always facing down as the tree originally came from Rock Hampton where it is really hot, dry and there is not much rain.  In the morning the leaves get due on them, so the leaves face down which makes the due drips off onto the roots to get nice and moist.  The Aboriginal people would get the flowers off of the paper bark trees and soak them in water then leave it for a while.  They would then come back, give it a stir than drink it.  The water would take out all of the nectar and pollen from the flower to make the water taste really sweet.  The drink is also good for sore throats and scratchy voices. The Paper Bark tree is a very big tree, it can grow up to 8 to 25 metres high and its branches grow out super wide. The best spot in the school for a paper bark tree is somewhere where there is no buildings and cramped trees as their roots grow pretty wide, but they are not invasive roots. The paper bark tree usually blossoms or flowers in Spring and Summer, so towards the end of the year. The Aboriginal people would take care of the trees by stripping off the bark and using it for other useful stuff.  Stripping the tree is also good for it in fire season, as it stops the fire burning the tree as much, because the bark burns easily, so the less on there the better it is. Most people think that the Aboriginal people were hunters and gatherers, But that is not right, the native people to this land were actually taking care of the land and only taking what they needed.  So, if they killed an animal, they would use every bit of it and not leave anything behind.   </label><font type="string">27.161281563942442px Garamond</font><font_size type="number">20</font_size><font_family type="string">Garamond</font_family><color type="string">#ffb35a</color><colorName type="string">Paint Fill</colorName><x type="number">0</x><y type="number">0</y><rotation type="number">0</rotation><flipx type="number">1</flipx><flipy type="number">1</flipy><height type="number">21</height><itemID type="number">7</itemID></item><item id="4"><productid type="string">78</productid><name type="string">Inscription (Bronze)</name><type type="string">Inscription</type><part type="string">Headstone</part><side type="string">Front</side><price type="number">0</price><quantity type="number">2157</quantity><label type="string">The Paper Bark tree (also known as Melaleuca in its botanical name) is a very important, special and useful tree.
