Edward Hunt MLC, who was a successful businessman, prominent colonial cabinet maker, councillor on the first Sydney Council and member of the Legislative Assembly.    The design of Hampton Villa is attributed to John Verge, the leading Sydney architect of the period. Hunt hired Verge to build his Jamieson Street showroom and house in 1833, then commissioned the most sought-after architect to build his home.  Typical of Verge, the design includes: sandstone quoining and very fine ashlar construction; deep stone-flagged verandah; hipped roof; generous proportions of rooms; exceptionally high ceilings for the period (14 feet); exceptionally fine cedar joinery that is a dominant feature of the interiors; the use of French doors with slender glazing bars and louvred shutters, including the non-glazed kick-panels in the French doors (a Verge trademark); the elevated situation of building with a commanding hill top view, and the careful situation of the building within a planned and ordered landscape.  Hampton Villa is also associated with a number of prominent colonial personalities, most notably Sir Henry Parkes, who lived at Hampton Villa between 1888 and 1892 during his term as Premier of NSW; and Eliezer Levi Montefiori, businessman, etcher, gallery director and founder of the Art Gallery of NSW in 1880.  Hampton Villa has social significance for its role in the lead up to the Federation of Australia as the home and office of Sir Henry Parkes, as it was the venue for at least one NSW Cabinet meeting and various government business during the 1890 constitutional debates.  The site is also significant for the operation of the Knitting Co, established by the Wilson family, which employed 52 local women in the early years of the twentieth century, making it at the forefront of changing work practices and one of the main employers of women in the Balmain area at this time.  Placed on the State Heritage Register in 2005, Hampton Villa remains as a rare surviving example of an early Victorian marine villa on the Balmain peninsula. Throughout Sydney, villas of this type are becoming increasingly rare. Its prominent position, and maintained views to the water are equally rare as modern harbourside development overshadows earlier surviving colonial structures.<br/>13&frasl;16″  Garamond #ffb35a</p></td><td><p>1</td><td>$40.86</td><td>$40.86</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Product ID: 78 - Inscription (Bronze)</strong><br/>Hampton Villa, c1847 was built by the Hon.
