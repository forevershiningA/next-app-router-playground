Lee Hall of Fame Coach Charlie Thompson Coach Charlie Thompson had a legendary career as one of the most successful coaches in Virginia history.  Everywhere he coached, he won.  His years at Lee, from 1978-1990, were among the most storied of his career. His Lee teams were known for their mental toughness, with an emphasis on defense and fundamentals.  His incredible success on the court however, was matched by the impact he had on the hundreds of young men that came through his program. Coach was intensely competitive, demanding, and had exacting standards with very high expectations. The lessons learned in his program went far beyond the practice court and, undoubtedly, provided life lessons that many still benefit from today. Players in his program learned valuable lessons about the importance of a strong work-ethic, commitment, teamwork, and a multitude of other virtues.  He was a giant."
