Serving the same retention purpose as the opposing granite wall, but at half its height, it effectively performed twice the work until it could no longer. In 2018, unrelenting spring rains caused the wall&apos;s east end to collapse, leading to discord in the city about who was responsible for restoring it.  A retired local engineer devised a restoration plan that resulted in collaboration with a generous contractor, extended fundraising, the partnership of two unrelenting men in their seventies, and three years of construction.    Once again, this embankment is securely in place. A taller wall now stands behind this plaque, featuring a 60-foot-long back wall made of concrete and steel, faced with salvaged stone. Set back and rising above it is an additional wall constructed from over 80 tons of raw stone mined from local sand pits and farmsteads, which were transported, hand-shaped, and meticulously positioned. Custom wire baskets, filled by hand with 14 tons of rock, now support the deteriorating east wall and the previously threatened stairway. Behind all this and more stands the unwavering determination of the two men.  Completed in November 2021, these walls now stand as a testament to resolute friendship and as monuments to history, civic pride, and commitment.   This plaque is dedicated in June 2025 to commemorate this work and the community&apos;s generosity, which was integral to its fulfillment. ____________________________________________  KEY PARTICIPANTS EDWARD ‘SANDY’ FEDDEMA & FLAVIA ALAYA   PROPERTY OWNERS JEFFREY R.
