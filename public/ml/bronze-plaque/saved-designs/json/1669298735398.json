I&apos;ll tell you one fuckin&apos; thing, I hope we get fuckin&apos; hotter than shit, just to stuff it up them 3,000 fuckin&apos; people that show up every fuckin&apos; day, because if they&apos;re the real Chicago fuckin&apos; fans, they can kiss my fuckin&apos; ass right downtown and PRINT IT.  \"They&apos;re really, really behind you around here... my fuckin&apos; ass. What the fuck am I supposed to do, go out there and let my fuckin&apos; players get destroyed every day and be quiet about it? For the fuckin&apos; nickel-dime people who turn up? The motherfuckers don&apos;t even work. That&apos;s why they&apos;re out at the fuckin&apos; game. They oughta go out and get a fuckin&apos; job and find out what it&apos;s like to go out and earn a fuckin&apos; living. Eighty-five percent of the fuckin&apos; world is working. The other fifteen percent come out here. A fuckin&apos; playground for the cocksuckers. Rip them motherfuckers. Rip them fuckin&apos; cocksuckers like the fuckin&apos; players. we got guys bustin&apos; their fuckin&apos; ass, and them fuckin&apos; people boo. And that&apos;s the Cubs? My players get around here. I haven&apos;t seen it this fuckin&apos; year. Everybody associated with this organization have been winners their whole fuckin&apos; life. Everybody. And the credit is not given in that respect.  \"Alright, they don&apos;t show because we&apos;re 5 and 14... and unfortunately, that&apos;s the criteria of them dumb 15 motherfuckin&apos; percent that come out to day baseball. The other 85 percent are earning a living. I tell you, it&apos;ll take more than a 5 and 12 or 5 and 14 to destroy the makeup of this club. I guarantee you that. There&apos;s some fuckin&apos; pros out there that wanna win. But you&apos;re stuck in a fuckin&apos; stigma of the fuckin&apos; Dodgers and the Phillies and the Cardinals and all that cheap shit. It&apos;s unbelievable. It really is. It&apos;s a disheartening fuckin&apos; situation that we&apos;re in right now. Anybody who was associated with the Cub organization four or five years ago that came back and sees the multitude of progress that&apos;s been made will understand that if they&apos;re baseball people, that 5 and 14 doesn&apos;t negate all that work. We got 143 fuckin&apos; games left.  \"What I&apos;m tryin&apos; to say is don&apos;t rip them fuckin&apos; guys out there. Rip me. If you wanna rip somebody, rip my fuckin&apos; ass. But don&apos;t rip them fuckin&apos; guys &apos;cause they&apos;re givin&apos; everything they can give. And right now they&apos;re tryin&apos; to do more than God gave &apos;em, and that&apos;s why we make the simple mistakes. That&apos;s exactly why.\" -Lee Elia, April 29, 1983","font":"32.266347141389936px Garamond","font_size":20,"font_family":"Garamond","color":"#ffb35a","colorName":"Paint Fill","x":0,"y":0,"rotation":0,"flipx":1,"flipy":1,"height":20,"itemID":2}]
