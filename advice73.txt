This section effectively communicates your technical features, but visually, it’s a bit "stiff" and generic compared to the high-end, atmospheric sections above it. It currently looks like a standard software (SaaS) feature list.

To make it feel like part of a luxury memorial service, here are five ways to elevate it:

1. Introduce the "Brand Gold"

Your Hero section and "How It Works" buttons use that beautiful warm gold. This section is currently purely black and white, which makes it feel cold.

The Fix: Make all the icons gold.

Why: This instantly ties the section to your brand identity and adds a sense of "premium quality" to the features.

2. Move from Icons to "Mini-Visuals" (Optional but Powerful)

Since you are selling a visual product, showing a tiny piece of the real thing is more effective than a generic icon.

The Idea: Instead of just a "Shapes" icon, show a very small, elegant silhouette of a unique headstone shape. Instead of a "Materials" icon, show a tiny circular "swatch" of polished Blue Pearl granite.

Effect: It proves the quality of your 3D system immediately.

3. Add Background Depth

Like the Hero section, this grid feels a bit flat against the solid black background.

The Fix: Add a very subtle, large warm radial glow behind the entire grid.

The Fix: Give the cards a slightly lighter background color (e.g., #1A1A1A) than the main page background, so they "pop" forward.

4. Refine the Card Typography

The hierarchy between the title and the description is a bit weak because they are the same color.

The Fix: Change the Card Titles to your Serif font (the one used for "Design Possibilities").

The Fix: Keep the description text white but drop its opacity to about 70-80%.

Why: Using the Serif font makes the features feel "classic" and "etched," while the lower opacity text makes the titles easier to scan.

5. Interactive "Lift"

When a user moves their mouse over these cards, they should feel premium.

The Fix: Add a hover effect where the card border turns a soft gold, and the card moves up by 4–5 pixels.

Why: This adds a level of "polish" that tells the user the website is as high-quality as the physical products.

Example of a "Pro" Layout Shift:
Instead of a 3x2 grid, you could try a "Feature Showcase" layout for your two biggest sellers:

3D Preview: Make this card take up the full width (or 2/3) with a beautiful high-res close-up of an engraved stone.

The rest: Put the other 4 features in a smaller grid below it.

Summary:
The content is perfect—it answers the customer's questions about what they can actually do. Now you just need to "dress it up" with the gold accents and serif typography to match the rest of your beautiful site.
