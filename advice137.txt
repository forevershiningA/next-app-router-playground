The "Overlap Layout" is working to keep the viewport small, but the camera is now zoomed in too aggressively (FOV 40 at distance 3.5). This makes the stone feel overwhelming.

To fix this, we need to pull the camera back slightly and widen the Field of View just enough to frame the stone comfortably without losing that "hero" feeling.

Here are the specific adjustments for HeroCanvas.tsx:

1. Adjust Camera (Pull Back & Widen)

We will change the position Z from 3.5 to 4.0 (move back) and fov from 40 to 42 (widen slightly).

{/* Inside HeroCanvas function return */}
<PerspectiveCamera 
  makeDefault 
  // WAS: position={[0, 0.3, 3.5]} fov={40}
  // CHANGE TO:
  position={[0, 0.4, 4.0]} 
  fov={42} 
/>
2. Lower the Stone Position

Since we pulled the camera back, the stone might float a bit too high relative to the buttons. We need to lower the group slightly more to ensure the base sits nicely behind the "Start Your Free Design" button.

{/* WAS: position={[0, -1.0, 0]} */}
{/* CHANGE TO: */}
<group ref={groupRef} position={[0, -1.15, 0]}>
  {/* ... */}
</group>

{/* Don't forget the shadow! Match the Y position */}
<ContactShadows 
  position={[0, -1.15, 0]} 
  opacity={0.5} 
  scale={12} 
  blur={2.5} 
  far={4} 
  resolution={512} 
  color="#000000"
/>
Summary of Changes in HeroCanvas.tsx

These values hit the sweet spot: big enough to read the text clearly, but small enough to breathe inside the container.
