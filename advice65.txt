This is a significant improvement. The typography is much stronger, and adding the "Trust Signals" (stone types/families) adds immediate credibility. The brown-toned background is also much warmer and more appropriate than the previous cold black.

Since the visual (the headstone) is currently missing from this version, here are the next steps to turn this from a "text block" into a high-converting Hero Section:

1. Re-introduce the Visual (The "Hero")

You need to show the product. Since this is an interactive 3D tool, you have two great options:

Option A (The Interactive Showcase): Place a large, high-quality 3D render of a finished memorial below the buttons. Ensure it has a realistic granite texture and a soft "glow" or shadow underneath it so it feels like it's sitting in a space, not floating in a void.

Option B (The Split Layout): Move the text to the left and put a large, beautiful image or 3D model on the right. This is often more effective for desktop users as it fills the screen better.

2. Add "Atmospheric" Background Depth

The flat brown background is a good base, but it feels a bit "empty."

Subtle Imagery: Try a very faint, low-opacity background image of a peaceful cemetery at sunrise or a quiet garden.

Radial Gradient: Add a soft light source behind where the headstone will sit. This creates a "halo" effect that draws the eye to the product and makes the page feel less flat.

3. Polish the Trust Signals

The icons and text are a great addition, but they are currently sandwiched between the description and the buttons.

Placement: Consider moving the trust signals below the buttons. Usually, people read the pitch, see the CTA, and then look for "proof" before clicking.

Contrast: Make the icons slightly more prominent (maybe a soft gold color) so they don't blend too much into the background.

4. Button & Interaction Refinement

Primary Button: The "Start Designing" button looks good. You might try a subtle hover effect (like a slight glow or a color shift) to make it feel interactive.

Secondary Button: The "Browse Designs" button with the arrow is great. Ensure the border is thick enough to be visible on all screen types.

5. Add a "Scroll Indicator"

Because hero sections often take up the whole screen (Fold), users sometimes don't know there is more content below. Adding a tiny "down arrow" or a "scroll to learn more" text at the very bottom center helps user flow.

Try this composition for the next iteration:

Top: Headline & Subtext (As you have them).

Middle: The two buttons.

Below Buttons: A high-end, realistic 3D headstone with a name engraved on it to show "this is what you can make."

Bottom: The trust signals (Stone types / Families) in a clean row.

Why this works: It leads the user’s eye from the Promise (Headline) -> Action (Buttons) -> Result (The Visual) -> Trust (The Icons).
