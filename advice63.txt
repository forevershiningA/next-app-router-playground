This is a very logical layout for the Base tab. You've solved the "crowded" problem by aligning the inputs and adding helpful descriptions for the technical terms (Polished vs. Rock Pitch).

Here are a few final UX polish points for this specific screen:

1. Conditional Logic (The "No Base" problem)

The biggest UX risk here is what happens when a user selects "No Base".

The Fix: If "No Base" is selected, the Width and Height sliders/inputs should immediately gray out (disable).

Why: You don't want a user to spend time adjusting the width of a base that they’ve already decided doesn't exist. It provides immediate visual feedback that those settings are now irrelevant.

2. Tab Navigation Feedback

Recommendation: When a user switches from the "Headstone" tab to the "Base" tab, ensure the 3D model (if you have one) highlights the base or changes the camera angle.

Why: It connects the UI tab they just clicked to the physical part of the product they are editing.

3. Tighten the Input/Unit Proximity

The Fix: Move the "mm" text closer to the numeric input box.

Why: Currently, there is quite a large gap. In UI design, proximity implies relationship. Keeping them close makes them read as one single value (e.g., "840mm") rather than two separate pieces of information.

4. Finish Selection (Visual Cards?)

The vertical list with descriptions is very clear, but it takes up a lot of vertical space.

Alternative: If you find the panel is getting too long, you could turn these into "Selectable Cards" (small boxes with an icon of the texture and the name below it).

However, your current list format is more accessible for mobile users because the tap targets are large.

5. Check your Industry Terms

Question: Is the base "Height" actually its Thickness?

In the monument industry, a base usually has Width (left to right), Depth (front to back), and Height/Thickness (how tall it sits off the ground).

If your "Headstone" tab has "Thickness," users might expect the Base tab to have it too. Using consistent names across tabs helps reduce confusion.

Final Verdict:
You have moved from a cluttered, confusing initial draft to a high-quality configurator. The inclusion of descriptions for "Rock Pitch" and "Polished" is a "pro-level" touch that will significantly reduce customer support questions.
