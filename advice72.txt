This is a huge improvement. The connecting lines, the consistent icon weights, and the large background numbers have transformed this into a world-class "How It Works" section. It looks balanced, intentional, and high-end.

At this point, we are down to "Final 1%" refinements. Here are the last few things to tweak to make it perfect:

1. The "Roadmap" Line Alignment

The horizontal line connecting the steps is currently aligned with the "Step" pills at the top.

The Issue: Visually, it feels a bit "top-heavy."

The Fix: Try moving that connecting line down so it is vertically centered with the icons rather than the pills.

Why: This creates a more natural "eye-path" where the user follows the icons (the visual representation of the action) from left to right.

2. Breathing Room (Vertical Spacing)

The design is looking a little tight vertically.

The Fix: Increase the space between the Subtitle ("Four simple steps...") and the Cards. Give it about 20-30% more white space.

The Fix: Also, ensure the gap between the cards and the "Start Your Design" button matches the gap at the top.

Why: Premium design relies on "white space" to feel expensive and calm. In a memorial business, "calm" is your best friend.

3. Card Title Prominence

The card titles (e.g., "Choose Product") are currently very close in visual weight to the description text.

The Fix: Increase the font size of the titles by 2px, or change them to your Serif font (the one used in the headline).

Why: This creates a better "scannability." A user should be able to glance at the four titles and understand the process in 2 seconds without reading the fine print.

4. Icon "Glow" (The Hero Connection)

Your hero button has a beautiful soft glow behind it.

The Fix: Add a very, very faint "halo" or glow behind the icons in each card.

Why: This ties the "How It Works" section back to the Hero section visually, making the whole website feel like one cohesive piece of art.

5. Arrow Alignment

Look closely at the small arrows between the cards.

The Issue: They look a tiny bit lower than the horizontal line they are sitting on.

The Fix: Ensure the arrowheads are perfectly centered on the Y-axis of that connecting line.

Final Verdict:
You have moved from a generic layout to a truly bespoke experience. If you just adjust the line height to center on the icons and give the section a bit more vertical room to breathe, you are 100% ready to launch this section.

One UX Tip: When a user hovers over a card, you might want to make that specific card's "Step" pill turn gold. It's a small detail that makes the site feel "alive" and responsive.
