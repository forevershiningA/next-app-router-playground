Nice—now the wrapper is really locked to the slanted face and your children are finally riding that plane. What you’re seeing now (subtle “not quite flush”, clipping near the right edge, occasional shimmer) is depth-ordering, not rotation.

Do these tiny, surgical tweaks in your current file to finish it off:

### 1) Put the children *slightly* further off the face (epsilon that scales with scene)

In the **slant** branch where you build `apiData`, replace the fixed `frontZ: 0.001` with a scale-aware epsilon:

```ts
// world units per SVG unit = scale * sCore
const worldUnit = Math.abs(scale) * sCore;
// ~0.5 mm offset (tweakable), keeps text/motifs ahead of granite at grazing angles
const frontZEps = Math.max(0.0005, 0.5e-3);

// ...
apiData: {
  frontZ: frontZEps,            // was 0.001
  unitsPerMeter: 1 / Math.max(EPS, scale * sCore),
  version: Math.random(),
  worldWidth: worldW,
  worldHeight: worldSlantH
},
```

### 2) Make the child group render after the stone (prevents z-fights)

Give the FaceSpace a higher render order:

```tsx
<FaceSpace
  quat={childWrapperRotation}
  width={apiData?.worldWidth || 1}
  slantHeight={apiData?.worldHeight || 1}
  z={apiData?.frontZ || 0.001}
>
  <group renderOrder={10} scale={meshScale}>
    {typeof children === 'function' && children(childApi, selectedAdditions)}
  </group>
</FaceSpace>
```

(Your headstone mesh will keep the default `renderOrder` of 0, so inscriptions/motifs reliably draw on top.)

### 3) Optional belt-and-braces: enable polygon offset on the granite materials

This nudges the granite into the depth buffer so thin meshes over it never flicker.

```ts
return [
  new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
    ...common,
    map: clonedFaceMap,
    polygonOffset: true,
    polygonOffsetFactor: 1,
    polygonOffsetUnits: 1,
  }),
  new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
    ...common,
    map: clonedSideMap,
    normalMap: rockNormalTexture,
    normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(2.0, 2.0),
    polygonOffset: true,
    polygonOffsetFactor: 1,
    polygonOffsetUnits: 1,
  })
];
```

### 4) Keep the good fixes you already have

* Slant wrapper Z uses `depth/2 * scale` (no `sCore`) ✅
* Quaternion alignment to the front-face normal ✅
* `FaceSpace` re-applies the quaternion each frame to defeat any child `lookAt`/billboard ✅
* `worldHeight` reports **slant** height so children scale along the plane ✅

With the epsilon + render order (and optional polygon offset), the inscriptions/motifs/additions will stay crisp, sit visibly on the slanted face, and won’t vanish on edge angles. Your latest commit shows the geometry/UVs/material grouping are already in great shape—these are just the last 1% to make it bullet-proof.
