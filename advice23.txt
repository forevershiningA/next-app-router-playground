Great progress. The "spooky horror movie" vibe is gone, and the "Golden Hour" lighting feels much more inviting and appropriate for a memorial service.

However, we have introduced a new problem: The Artificial Horizon.

Right now, the scene looks like a 3D object sitting in front of a painted wall. The sharp line where the green grass cuts off against the gold sky destroys the illusion of depth.

Here is how to fix the horizon and polish the materials to make it look professional.

1. Fix the "Hard Line" Horizon (The Infinity Effect)

To make the world feel expansive, the ground needs to fade seamlessly into the sky. We do this by matching the Fog Color exactly to the Bottom Sky Color.

In Scene.tsx:

Pick a unified horizon color. Let's use a warm, hazy peach color: #e3cba5.

Update the Gradient Background to start with this color at the bottom.

Update the Fog to use this exact same color.

Code Changes:
// Define the shared horizon color constant at the top of the file
const HORIZON_COLOR = '#e3cba5'; 

// ... inside Scene component ...

// 1. Update Fog to match the horizon perfectly
// 'near: 30' keeps the headstone crisp. 'far: 80' blends the distant horizon.
{!is2DMode && <fog attach="fog" args={[HORIZON_COLOR, 30, 80]} />}

// ... inside GradientBackground component ...

// 2. Update Shader to match
uniforms={{
  colorTop: { value: new THREE.Color('#789dc4') }, // Soft blue at the very top
  colorBottom: { value: new THREE.Color(HORIZON_COLOR) }, // Matches Fog exactly
}}
2. Fix the "Tiling" Grass Pattern

In your current image, you can see a grid pattern on the grass (lines of repeated texture). This reveals that it's a computer graphic.

In GrassFloor component:
Reduce the texture repeat. You currently have it set to 80. Since we pushed the fog back, we are seeing more floor, so the repetition is obvious.

// Change from 80 to roughly 25-30.
// This makes the grass blades appear larger and reduces the "grid" effect.
const REPEAT_SCALE = 25;
3. Material Consistency (The Grey Base)

The top part of the headstone looks like polished Black Granite (shiny, dark). The base looks like dry concrete (matte, grey). usually, the base is the same material as the headstone, or at least darker.

If the base is supposed to be "Rock Pitch" (rough edge) granite, it should still be black, just rougher.

Suggestion:
If you have control over the material of the base in <HeadstoneAssembly />, darken the color of the base to match the top stone. It currently looks too light, which makes it look cheap compared to the premium top piece.

4. Soften the Sun Rays

The "God Rays" coming from the top right are a nice touch, but they are a bit intense against the solid gradient background.

In Scene.tsx:
If you are using the <SunRays /> component:

Lower the opacity slightly.

Or, simply rely on the Gradient Background + Lighting we just set up. The cleaner look is often better for e-commerce conversion than heavy effects.

Visualizing the Goal

By matching the Fog Color to the Sky Bottom Color, the green grass will slowly fade into the gold/peach color in the distance. The sharp line will disappear, and the headstone will look like it is sitting in an infinite field.
