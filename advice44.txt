Big jump. The slant wrapper is finally correct and your children are living on that plane. What I still see:

* slight shimmer/overdraw between stacked lines,
* occasional “rub” at the right edge where content bleeds past the trapezoid,
* debug helpers still in scene.

Here’s the tight finish:

1. Draw inscriptions/motifs **after** granite and don’t write to depth
   In the components that render gold text/motifs:

```ts
// for MeshStandard/Physical materials used on on-stone graphics
material.depthWrite = false;   // keep depthTest = true
mesh.renderOrder = 10;         // or set on the group that contains all children
```

(You already set `renderOrder={10}` on the FaceSpace child group — keep that.)
This removes line-on-line z fighting. 

2. Keep a small world-space face offset
   You’ve got `frontZ` now; lock it around ~0.5–1.5 mm:

```ts
const frontZEps = 0.001;   // ~1 mm world
apiData.frontZ = frontZEps;
```

3. Nudge the granite with polygon offset (you already did)
   Leave the polygonOffset on both granite materials to bias the depth buffer in the stone’s favor. That + (1) = crisp overlay. 

4. Prevent edge bleed: clip children to the *front face* with a simple stencil mask (optional but clean)
   Add once, next to your headstone mesh:

```tsx
{/* Stencil: write the front-face region */}
<mesh geometry={geometries[0]} scale={meshScale} renderOrder={5}>
  <meshBasicMaterial
    colorWrite={false} depthWrite={false} depthTest
    stencilWrite
    stencilFunc={THREE.AlwaysStencilFunc}
    stencilRef={1}
    stencilZPass={THREE.ReplaceStencilOp}
    stencilZFail={THREE.ReplaceStencilOp}
  />
</mesh>
```

Then make on-stone children **only** draw where stencil==1:

```tsx
// In FaceSpace children container
<group renderOrder={10}>
  <meshStandardMaterial
    attach="material"
    depthWrite={false}
    stencilWrite
    stencilRef={1}
    stencilFunc={THREE.EqualStencilFunc}
  />
  {children(api, selectedAdditions)}
</group>
```

(If your children supply their own materials, set the same `stencil*` props on those.)

5. Remove the debug helpers
   Drop the pink plane and `<axesHelper>` once you’re done, to avoid interfering with picking and overall look. 

6. Final sanity for slant placement
   Keep the two critical lines you now have:

* `childWrapperPos = [0, 0, (depth/2) * scale]` (Z matches mesh Z scale)
* `childWrapperRotation = Quaternion(setFromUnitVectors( +Z → frontNormal ))`

…and keep `FaceSpace` applying that quaternion each frame so no billboard/lookAt can defeat it. ✔️ 

Apply 1–3 (and 5); if you want bullet-proof edge containment, add 4. After that, slant and upright should both be solid.
