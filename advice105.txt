You’ve killed 90% of it; what’s left is coming from **global IBL + fog blending**.

What I see in your files:

* You still mount a `<Environment preset="forest" />` with no `intensity` prop, so it runs at **1.0** and adds a cool skylight lobe. Even though the grass material has `envMapIntensity={0}`, the PMREM still lifts diffuse lighting scene-wide and makes the ground read a bit cool from the front angle. 
* Scene fog is active and starts fairly close (`80 → 160`), so mid-distance grass blends toward the fog/screen colors; with a teal zenith in the sky, our perception is that the grass is still “bluish.”

Do these three small tweaks and it should go fully neutral:

1. Tame the environment IBL

```tsx
<Environment
  preset="forest"
  intensity={0.2}        // was implicit 1.0
  background={false}
  rotation={[0, Math.PI / 2, 0]}
/>
```

(If you want glossy granite to keep nice reflections, you can raise only the stone’s `envMapIntensity` and leave the global `intensity` low.) 

2. Keep fog off the grass (so it won’t blend toward any non-green hue)

```tsx
<meshStandardMaterial
  {...props}
  color={GRASS_COLOR}
  roughness={0.9}
  normalScale={new THREE.Vector2(0.5, 0.5)}
  metalness={0}
  envMapIntensity={0}
  fog={false}            // <- add this
/>
```

Or, alternatively, push fog farther out to affect only the distant horizon:

```tsx
<fog attach="fog" args={['#dfe6df', 140, 300]} />
```



3. Slightly warm the ambient/sky fill balance
   Add a gentle hemisphere fill to bias ground lighting green/neutral and counter any residual coolness from the sky:

```tsx
<hemisphereLight
  skyColor="#dfe6df"
  groundColor="#3b5b2b"
  intensity={0.25}
/>
```

(Keep your existing warm key/fill/rim; they’re fine.) 

Why this works

* Lower IBL intensity removes the last cool wash that was lifting the ground.
* Disabling (or pushing back) fog prevents mid-ground grass from color-mixing with the screen/sky.
* A subtle hemisphere light re-centers the diffuse balance toward natural green.

If you still see any tint after that, it’ll be baked into the **grass albedo texture** itself; in that case, keep `color={GRASS_COLOR}` as you have and, if needed, nudge it a touch warmer (e.g., `#31571a`).
