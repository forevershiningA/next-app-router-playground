This is a clean, respectful interface, but the current color scheme (specifically the muddy mustard/brown used for the buttons and active states) clashes with the cool, airy light blue background. It feels a bit dated and creates a "muddy" visual vibration.

Here are specific design improvements to elevate the look, improve contrast, and create a more premium user experience.

1. Color Palette Overhaul

The goal is to move away from the muddy brown and choose colors that harmonize with the background (#EAF4FC) and the Blue Pearl granite texture.

Option A: Trust & Serenity (Deep Navy)
This is the safest, most professional route. It provides high contrast and feels dignified.

Primary Action (CTA): Deep Navy Blue (#102A43 or #1B3B5A)

Secondary Action: White fill with Navy border.

Text: Dark Slate Blue (#243B53) instead of pure black.

Option B: Premium & Warmth (Refined Bronze)
If you want to keep the gold tone to match the lettering on the stone, you need a cleaner, metallic shade, not a flat brown.

Primary Action (CTA): Metallic Bronze/Copper (#B08D55 or #C5A065).

Secondary Action: Dark Grey outline (#486581).

2. UI Element Improvements
The Call to Action (CTA) Buttons

"Next: Material" Button:

Color: Change the background to the Deep Navy (#1B3B5A). This creates a beautiful, solid anchor against the light blue background.

Shape: Keep the pill shape; it works well.

Shadow: Add a soft drop shadow (box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(27, 59, 90, 0.2)) to lift it off the page and make it feel clickable.

Text: Keep it white, but maybe increase the font weight slightly to "Medium."

"Browse Designs" Button:

Style: Change the border color to match the new Navy CTA (#1B3B5A).

Text: Change the text color to match the border.

The Progress Bar (Steps 1-4)

Active State (Step 1): Change the background color of the "Shape" pill to match your new Primary CTA color (Navy).

Inactive States: The grey text is currently a bit too light. Darken the text for "Material," "Personalise," and "Review" to ensure better readability (Accessibility compliance).

Container: The white pill container is good, but add a very subtle border (#DCEEFB) to define it better against the background.

The Product Preview (Headstone)

Grounding: The stone currently feels like it is floating. Add a stronger, spread-out drop shadow underneath the base of the headstone. This will "place" the object in the 3D space.

Readability Issue: The text "Selected Shape: Half Round" is nearly invisible (dark grey on dark granite).

Fix: Move this text below the stone image (above the progress bar).

Alternative: If it must stay on the image, change the text color to White and add a subtle text shadow.

Typography

Headline: "Design a Beautiful Tribute" is in a serif font (likely Playfair Display). It looks good. To make it richer, change the color from Black to a Very Dark Blue (#102A43). This makes the design feel more cohesive than stark black.

Visual Mockup Description (The "After" Look)

Imagine the page now:

Background: Remains the soft Light Blue.

Headstone: Has a soft shadow grounding it. The "Selected Shape" text is moved below it, clearly visible in dark grey.

Progress Bar: The "1 Shape" bubble is a rich Royal Navy Blue.

Buttons: The big "Next" button is that same Royal Navy Blue with crisp white text. It pops off the screen. The "Browse" button has a thin Navy outline and Navy text.

Why this works:

Complementary Colors: Navy and Light Blue are monochromatic and harmonious. The Gold text on the stone becomes the highlight accent, rather than competing with a mustard-colored button below it.

Hierarchy: The dark Navy draws the eye immediately to the "Next" action, which is the primary goal of the page.
