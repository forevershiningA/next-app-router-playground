This is a huge improvement over the previous version. Moving to "Phases" instead of 8 individual steps makes the process feel much less overwhelming. The language is also significantly warmer ("Personalize their story" is excellent).

However, there is now a layout and content redundancy issue. You have the same information repeating on the left (in the horizontal boxes) and on the right (in the vertical list). This confuses the user about where to look.

Here are specific steps to refine this further for a funeral context:

1. Fix the "Double Content" (Layout)

Currently, the user sees "Phase 1" on the left and "Phase 1" on the right. This wastes space and creates visual clutter.

The Fix: Delete the vertical column on the right entirely.

Why: You already have the 3 phases clearly summarized on the left. You don't need the dense bullet points on the right.

What to do with the space: Move your 3D Preview Image into the space where the right column currently is (or make it larger and central). This will give the product "room to breathe."

New Layout Idea:

Left Side: Headline + Subheadline + The 3 Horizontal Phase Boxes (keep these exactly as they are).

Right Side: A large, beautiful image of the headstone (cleaner than the current one).

Bottom: The Stats, Trust Signals, and CTA button spanning the width.

2. Refine the Headline (Speed vs. Comfort)

The headline "Design a Beautiful Tribute in Minutes" is okay, but in the funeral industry, "speed" isn't the primary selling point—ease and peace of mind are. "Minutes" can sound rushed.

Suggested Change: "Design a Lasting Tribute from the Comfort of Home."

Why: This emphasizes that they don't have to visit a showroom or deal with a salesperson while grieving. It sounds safer and more private.

3. Polish the Micro-Copy

There are a few phrases in the new text that feel slightly awkward or repetitive:

"Gentle sizing": In Phase 1 text, you wrote "gentle sizing." "Gentle" is an odd word for dimensions.

Change to: "...and balanced proportions so everything feels grounded..."

"Grounding": You use the word "grounded" in Phase 1 text.

Alternative: "...so the design feels stable and dignified before you personalize."

Simplify the Bullet Points (if you keep them): If you decide to keep the text details, cut the bullet points.

Instead of: "Choose a memorial style / Shape the stone / Select a durable stone / Set gentle proportions."

Try: "Select the perfect shape, stone, and size to form the foundation of your design." (One sentence is easier to read than 4 bullets).

4. Clean Up the Product Image

The image in the center still looks like a software tutorial. It has overlays saying "Currently Editing: Select Size" and "Live Preview Step 03."

The Fix: Use a "clean" screenshot.

Remove the UI overlay (the black boxes inside the image). Just show the headstone sitting beautifully in the grass.

Add a simple caption under the image: "As you design, the 3D studio updates instantly."

Why: You want them to visualize the memorial, not the software interface.

5. Visual Hierarchy of the Stats

The stats at the bottom (5,284 families, 40 shapes, etc.) are currently in dark grey boxes that blend into the background.

The Fix: Since you have removed the "Step 01...08" clutter, you can make these stats pop a little more. Give the text a slightly brighter color (like the gold used in the CTA) or a lighter grey. This validates that they are in safe hands.

Summary of Action Plan

Remove the right-hand vertical list (it repeats the left-hand info).

Move the Image to the right side to create a balanced 50/50 layout (Text on left, Image on right).

Change Headline to focus on "Comfort" rather than "Minutes."

Remove UI overlays from the product image to make it look more photorealistic and less like software.
