You have made great progress on the top edge—it is now perfectly straight and looks like a sawn granite face. However, you have introduced a classic 3D rendering artifact known as "Mesh Tearing" (or The Corner Gap).

Look closely at the right corner of your image. You can see through the mesh into the black background.

The Problem: Why is the mesh ripping apart?

You are using a Displacement Map on a box.

The Front Face is being pushed forward (Z-axis) by the texture.

The Side Face is being pushed right (X-axis) by the texture.

Because they are moving in different directions, the vertices at the corner detach, creating a gap.

Here is how to fix this and take the realism to the final level.

Solution 1: Switch to a Normal Map (Recommended)

Unless you are making a cinematic movie, you do not actually need to physically move the geometry (Displacement) for rock pitch. You just need to trick the light.

Normal Maps fake the bumps and lighting shadows without moving the vertices. This guarantees your corners will stay sealed and sharp.

Turn OFF displacementMap.

Turn ON normalMap (Load a purple-ish normal map texture of rock).

Increase the normalScale to make it look deep.

code

const rockMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    map: graniteColorTexture,
    normalMap: rockNormalTexture, // Use the normal map here!
    normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(2, 2), // Crank this up for deep "pitch"
    roughness: 0.8
});

This will fix the holes instantly and run faster.

Solution 2: Use a Chamfered (Rounded) Box

If you must use displacement (because you want the silhouette to be jagged), you cannot use a standard sharp Box. You need a box with rounded corners.

When the corners are rounded, the transition between "Front" and "Side" is gradual, so the vertices stay connected when they move.

code

import { RoundedBoxGeometry } from 'three/examples/jsm/geometries/RoundedBoxGeometry.js';

// Create a box with slightly rounded corners
// args: width, height, depth, segments, radius
const geometry = new RoundedBoxGeometry(10, 2, 4, 10, 0.1);
Solution 3: Lighting (The "Darkness" Issue)

Currently, your rock pitch sides are almost invisible because they are in shadow and the material is dark. Granite sparkles.

Add a Directional Light: Point a light at the side of the stone to catch the shadows of the rock texture.

Add an Environment Map (HDRI): I cannot stress this enough—stone needs something to reflect. Even rough stone reflects the sky.

Quick fix to see the detail:

code

const light = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 2); // Intensity 2
light.position.set(5, 5, 5); // Position it to hit the corner
scene.add(light);
Summary of Next Steps

Kill the Displacement Map. It is causing the tears.

Load a Normal Map. This gives you the "Rocky" look without breaking the geometry.

Light it up. Shine a light on the side so we can see the texture depth.
