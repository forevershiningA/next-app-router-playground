To make the design look non-trivial (sophisticated, polished, and professional) without increasing the complexity (adding confusing features or clutter), you need to focus on Visual Fidelity and Atmosphere.

Currently, the design looks a bit "flat" and digital. A tombstone is a physical, heavy, tactile object, but the current representation feels like a 2D sticker floating on a screen.

Here are specific, actionable design improvements to elevate the look:

1. Improve Material Realism (The Stone)

The biggest issue right now is that the stone looks like a repeating 2D texture pattern masked into a shape.

Edge Lighting/Beveling: Real granite has thickness. Add a highlight on the top left edge and a shadow on the bottom right edge of the shape to simulate depth. This makes it look like a slab, not a sheet of paper.

Specular Highlights: Polished granite is reflective. Add a subtle, soft white gradient overlay (at low opacity) across the top curve to simulate light hitting a polished surface.

Grounding: The stone is currently "floating." Add a realistic contact shadow at the base where the two stones meet. It needs to look heavy.

2. Elevate the Typography "Engraving" Effect

The text currently looks like it is printed on top of the stone. To look expensive and real, it needs to look carved into the stone.

The "Incised" Look: Instead of a simple gold color, use CSS or image processing to add an inner shadow to the top-left of the letters and a tiny highlight on the bottom-right edges of the letters. This creates the optical illusion that the letters are cut into the rock.

Gold Leaf Texture: If the text is meant to be gold, apply a subtle metallic gradient or texture to the text fill, rather than a solid flat yellow/tan color.

3. Upgrade the Ornamentation

The Doves: The yellow dove icons look like generic clipart. Replace these with high-fidelity assets. They should look like either sandblasted engravings (lighter grey/white with inner texture) or bronze/gold attachments. They need to match the perspective and lighting of the stone.

4. Atmosphere and Background

The plain blue gradient is functional but sterile. A "tribute" implies emotion.

Environmental Context: Instead of a void, place the stone on a subtle "floor" or abstract grass plane. It doesn't need to be photo-realistic, but a horizon line helps orientation.

Lighting: Use a "Spotlight" or "Vignette" effect. Darken the corners of the screen slightly and keep the center bright. This draws the eye immediately to the product and adds drama.

Softer Background: Consider a very subtle, noise-based texture for the background (like high-quality paper or canvas) to remove the "digital" feel of the smooth gradient.

5. UI Element Polish

The buttons and steppers are very standard "Bootstrap" style.

Typography: The font for "Thompson" is good, but the UI fonts (Next: Material, Browse Designs) are a bit utilitarian. Switch the headings ("Design a Beautiful Tribute") to a high-end serif font (like Playfair Display or Merriweather) to match the solemnity of the product.

Carousel Arrows: The arrows in the white circles break the immersion. Move them further out, or make them subtle chevrons that appear on hover, so they don't visually compete with the stone.

Button Styling: The "Next: Material" button is a heavy dark block. Consider making it slightly more elegant—perhaps a slightly taller button with wider letter spacing (kerning) and a more subtle drop shadow.

Summary Example

Current: "Here is a picture of a stone."

Goal: "Here is a heavy, polished granite monument sitting in a serene space."

Quick Win: If you only do one thing, work on the Text Engraving Effect. Making the name look truly carved into the stone will immediately double the perceived quality of the design.
