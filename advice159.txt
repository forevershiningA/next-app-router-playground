Based on the current design, here is a breakdown of visual refinements to elevate the look and feel of the "Design a Beautiful Tribute" section.

1. Fix Color Contrast & Typography (Priority)

The most glaring issue is the readability of the main heading.

The Heading: The dark blue text ("Design a Beautiful Tribute") on the dark brown background is vibrating visually and is very hard to read.

Suggestion: Switch the heading color to White, a Soft Cream, or a Muted Gold (matching the text on the stone). This will create necessary contrast and elegance.

The Sub-text: The grey text below the heading is functional but could be lighter to improve legibility against the dark background.

2. Modernize the Stepper UI

The oval progress bar (Shape > Material > Personalise > Review) looks a bit dated and heavy with its solid grey background.

Transparency: Remove the solid grey background of the container pill. Instead, use a transparent background with a thin, elegant border (perhaps white or gold opacity at 30%).

Active State: Instead of a dark blue bubble for "Shape," consider using an underline or a glowing dot indicator. If you keep the bubble, make the inactive text lighter so the active step pops more.

Font: Use a slightly more spaced-out (tracking) sans-serif font for the steps to make it feel more premium.

3. Refine the Action Area (Bottom Buttons)

The buttons at the bottom feel disconnected from the rest of the design.

"Next: Material" Button: The text is heavy.

Suggestion: Change the button color to a Warm Gold or Bronze to match the commemorative feel, rather than corporate blue.

Label: Simplify the text to just "Next" with a chevron icon (Next →), or "Select Material".

"Browse Designs" Button: Ensure this button has the same border radius (roundness) as the "Next" button for consistency. Currently, they look slightly different in weight.

4. Enhance Product Realism

The 3D stone is the hero, but the elements on top of it look a bit "stuck on."

Engraving Effect: The doves and the text "HEART" look like flat yellow layers. Apply an Inner Shadow or Bevel/Emboss effect to them in the render. This will make them look carved into the stone rather than painted on it.

Grounding: The stone is floating in the void. Add a soft, diffuse drop shadow underneath the base of the monument to ground it on the page.

5. Layout & Atmosphere

Lighting: The background is a flat dark color. Consider adding a very subtle radial gradient (lighter in the center behind the stone, darker at the edges). This creates a "spotlight" effect that draws the eye naturally to the product.

Nav Arrows: The white circle arrows (left/right) are functional but stark. Consider making the white circles semi-transparent (glassmorphism effect) so they don't distract from the stone textures.

Summary of recommended palette change:

Background: Keep Dark Brown (warm/somber).

Text: White or Cream (readable).

Accents: Gold/Bronze (premium/respectful).

UI Elements: Semi-transparent/Glassy (modern).
