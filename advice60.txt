This version is now looking very solid and follows standard UX patterns. You have a clear hierarchy: Major Option → Component Selection → Style Choice → Precise Dimensions.

To take this from "functional" to "premium," here are the final touches I would recommend:

1. Handle "Conditional Visibility"

Now that "Add Base" is at the top, you need to decide what happens to the Base tab when it is unchecked.

The UX Fix: If "Add Base" is unchecked, the "Base" tab should be disabled (grayed out and unclickable).

Bonus: If they click the disabled "Base" tab, a small tooltip could appear saying, "Check 'Add Base' to configure."

2. Make the Shape Choice More Visual

The "Upright" and "Slant" radio buttons work, but they are a bit small.

The UX Fix: Consider using Button Toggles instead of radio buttons.

Why: A button toggle is a larger touch/click target and makes the "Active" state much clearer. When "Upright" is selected, the whole button could turn gold with a dark icon/text.

3. "Input Validation" & Feedback

What happens if a user types "50" into the Width box when the minimum is 300?

The UX Fix:

Auto-correct: If they type below 300, the box should automatically snap back to "300" when they click away (blur).

Visual Warning: Temporarily turn the border of the input box red if they type an invalid number.

4. Improve Icon Contrast

The icons for Upright and Slant (the little rectangles) are currently a very dark grey.

The UX Fix: Make the icon of the selected option white or gold. Leave the unselected one grey. This helps the user confirm their choice without having to read the text.

5. Micro-interactions (The "Feel")

Hover States: When the mouse hovers over a slider or a tab, give it a subtle glow or a slight color shift. This makes the UI feel "alive" and responsive.

Syncing: Ensure the slider moves as the user types in the box, and vice versa. There should be zero lag between the two.

6. Alignment Check

The "Add Base" checkbox is currently slightly off-center compared to the tab bar below it.

The horizontal divider line is a great addition, but make sure it has the same side-margins as the sliders to keep the "vertical line of sight" clean.

Final Verdict:
You have reached a point of diminishing returns on this specific panel—meaning it is already very good! Your next "UX leap" would be ensuring that as these values change, the 3D model or image preview of the headstone updates instantly and smoothly.
