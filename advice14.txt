This is a massive improvement. The copy is excellent ("Worthy of Their Memory" is perfect), and the button hierarchy is clear.

However, the layout is currently suffering from "Vertical Stacking Syndrome." You have 5 different elements stacked one on top of the other (Headline 
→
→
 Body 
→
→
 Buttons 
→
→
 Features 
→
→
 Testimonial). This leaves the right side of the screen empty and makes the page feel like a long list.

Here is the final Layout Restructure to make this look like a world-class landing page:

1. The "50/50" Split (Fix the Layout)

Instead of stacking everything in the center/left, split the screen into two distinct columns.

Left Column (The Action):

Headline ("Create a Tribute...")

Body Text ("Take your time...")

The Two Buttons

The Micro-Trust Row ("Fast • Secure • Live Preview")

Right Column (The Proof):

Take that large Testimonial Box from the bottom and move it to the Right Side.

Make it a vertical card.

Why: This puts the social proof next to the decision, validating the user's choice immediately. It fills the empty void on the right.

2. Delete the "Middle Features" (Reduce Clutter)

Look at the section between the buttons and the testimonial. You have a small grid of icons with text like "Design in minutes" and "Instant proof & quote."

The Fix: Delete this entire block.

Why: It is redundant. You already said "Fast" and "Live Preview" in the gold text row above it. These small paragraphs are too tiny to read and they distract from the main goal: clicking the button. Less is more.

3. Polish the Testimonial Card

When you move the testimonial to the right side, style it slightly differently to make it pop:

Background: Keep the dark card background, but maybe lighten it very slightly (dark charcoal) so it separates from the black page background.

The Quote: Make the font size larger. It’s the most persuasive text on the page.

The Stars: Make the gold stars bigger.

4. Background Ambience

Currently, the background is a muddy gradient with some faint ghost text ("2023") behind the buttons.

The Fix: Clean this up.

Option A: Go pure, elegant black.

Option B: Put a very subtle, darkened photo of a peaceful landscape (trees, sunset) behind the Right Side only (behind the testimonial). This adds emotion without messing up the text readability on the left.

Final Vision

Imagine the screen split down the middle:

Left: "Create a Tribute..." with a big bright Gold Button.

Right: A beautiful card saying "Seeing it live in 3D gave us complete confidence."

This layout connects the emotional need (Left) with the emotional solution (Right).
