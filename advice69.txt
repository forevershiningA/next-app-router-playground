This menu is functional, but it feels a bit repetitive and "utility-heavy." Since the rest of your site is leaning into a high-end, premium aesthetic, the menu should feel like a pro-grade design tool rather than just a list of buttons.

Here are a few ways to make it more intuitive and visually appealing:

1. Simplify the Language (Remove "Select")

Using the word "Select" in every line creates a lot of visual "noise" and makes the user read the same word over and over.

The Fix: Remove "Select" from every item.

New Labels:

Base Shape

Stone Material

Dimensions & Size

Inscription

Additions & Accents

Art & Motifs

Why: It’s cleaner, faster to read, and feels more like a professional editor (think Photoshop or Canva).

2. Group by "Workflow"

Right now, the items are just a flat list. It’s better to group them into the natural steps of designing a memorial.

Category 1: The Foundation (Product, Shape, Material, Size)

Category 2: Personalization (Inscriptions, Motifs, Additions)

Category 3: Review (Check Price)

The Fix: Add a tiny bit of extra spacing between these groups or use subtle sub-headers.

3. Improve Icon Meaning

Some of the icons are a bit generic. To make it feel premium, the icons should be very specific to the memorial industry:

Shape: Use an icon that looks like a headstone silhouette.

Material: Use a "texture" or "swatch" icon.

Inscriptions: Use a "T" (for text) or a chisel icon.

Motifs: Use a small flower or a decorative scroll icon.

4. Differentiate "Actions" from "Design Steps"

"New Design" and "Browse Designs" are actions, while "Shape" and "Material" are tabs/steps.

The Fix: Give the "Action" buttons (top and bottom) a different visual style (maybe a solid color or a different border) than the design steps in the middle.

Price: "Check Price" is a result. Consider making it a small floating card at the bottom or a distinct button with a subtle "gold" accent to match your "Start Designing" button.

5. Add "Active" States

How does the user know which section they are currently editing?

The Fix: Design a clear "Active" state. When someone is on "Material," that button should perhaps have a solid background or a colored border (using your brand's gold color) to show exactly where they are in the process.

6. Match the Brand Typography

Your hero section uses a beautiful serif font.

The Fix: Use that same serif font for the "DESIGN TOOLS" header. For the menu items themselves, keep the clean sans-serif you have, but perhaps make it slightly thinner or wider-spaced (letter-spacing) to give it a more "boutique" feel.

Example of a revised list order:

DESIGN TOOLS (Serif font)

[Setup]

Product Type

Base Shape

[Appearance]

Stone Material

Stone Size

[Customization]

Inscription

Motifs & Art

Accessories

[Finalize]

Check Price (Distinctive button)

One final tip: If this menu is on the left of the 3D view, ensure there is a "Collapse" button (a small < arrow) so the user can hide the menu and see their 3D design in full-screen. This is a standard "pro" feature that users love.
