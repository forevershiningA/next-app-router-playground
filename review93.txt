Here’s what’s off in this newest render (vs the original screen):

* **Framing/fit**

  * The headstone is **over-zoomed**; the **base is mostly cropped** (only a sliver shows at bottom-left).
  * Margins are tight all around, making everything feel pushed **up and inward**.

* **Top crest area**

  * The leaf-and-bird motif is **too large and too low**, overlapping the word **PINTO**.
  * **PINTO** sits lower and is partly crowded by the motif; spacing above it is reduced.

* **Header line (quote)**

  * The line starts **flush at the far left** and runs **past the right edge** (overflow, not centered).
  * Apostrophe is still **HTML-encoded**: `Heaven&apos;s` instead of **Heaven’s**.

* **Central statue**

  * Slightly **too high**; vertical balance is off. It also crowds the right name block.

* **Name blocks**

  * Both **JOHN TIMOTHY** (left) and **TERESA ISABELLA / NEE SALDANHA** (right) are **too high** and **too close to center**.
  * The right block overlaps visually with the statue; line spacing appears tighter than in the original.

* **Lower motifs**

  * **Lotus (left)** and **cross (right)** are **smaller and higher** than in the original.
  * The **dotted/ghost circle artefact** near the cross is still present.

* **General scaling**

  * Text and motifs are scaled **inconsistently** relative to the stone outline, and overall alignment (centering and vertical rhythm) doesn’t match the original.
