You are getting closer, but the issue is definitely that hard line where the brown meets the black. It creates a "horizon" that makes the 3D model look like it's floating on a strange platform in space.

In professional product design, you never show a hard corner between the wall and the floor. You want an "Infinity Background" (like a photo studio).

Here is the exact fix to blend that floor seamlessly so it looks premium, not like a video game.

1. The Fix: Use a "Spotlight" Gradient (No Hard Line)

Instead of splitting the screen into "Wall" and "Floor," use a Radial Gradient. This puts a pool of light behind/under the object and fades to black at the edges.

Replace your background CSS with this:

code
CSS
download
content_copy
expand_less
background: radial-gradient(
    circle at 50% 75%,    /* Centers the light low, behind the stone */
    #332a24 0%,           /* Center: Dark Warm Coffee/Charcoal */
    #1a1a1a 40%,          /* Middle: Dark Grey */
    #000000 85%           /* Edge: Pure Black */
);

Why this works:

Seamless: It removes that ugly horizontal line completely.

Warmth: The #332a24 color provides that non-depressive warmth you want, allowing the grey base to stand out.

Focus: It creates a natural vignette that draws the eye to the center.

2. The Missing Piece: The Shadow

Even with the gradient, the headstone will look like it is floating until you add a shadow.

The Fix: You must render a soft black shadow under the base.

If you can't do real-time shadows: Place a semi-transparent black oval image (.png) with a heavy blur directly underneath the 3D canvas object.

3. Quick UI Cleanup

Hide the Box: That yellow/white wireframe box is still visible. Hide it. It ruins the realism.

Input Fields: You still have the "Width" mm inside the box, but "Height" outside. Move the Width mm outside to match the others.

Verdict:
Switch to the Radial Gradient code above. It solves the "darkness" problem and the "ugly line" problem at the same time.
