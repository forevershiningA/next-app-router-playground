Great—now that the base shows, its **X/Y are computed right but applied in the wrong coordinate space**. It’s being positioned relative to a parent that isn’t the same coordinate system as the tablet (hence the thin strip halfway up, starting near the page’s left).

### What to change (two parts)

#### 1) Ensure the preview wrapper is the positioning context

Make the wrapper that also contains the tablet **`position: relative`** and put the base **inside this same wrapper** (after the tablet background, before text/motifs).

```tsx
// The same element that currently holds the tablet background
<div ref={svgHostRef} style={{
  position: 'relative',          // <-- make this the positioning context
  width: overlayW,
  height: overlayH,
  overflow: 'hidden'
}}>
  {/* tablet background here ... */}
  {/* <-- base div goes HERE */}
  {/* inscriptions/motifs go after */}
</div>
```

#### 2) Compute base X/Y in the tablet’s overlay space (not page space)

Use the fitted tablet bounds from `buildTopProfile` and convert from authoring → overlay px with the **same scale** as the tablet:

```tsx
// --- authoring → overlay scale (same mapping the tablet uses)
const sx = overlayW / initW;
const sy = overlayH / initH;

// --- fitted tablet bounds (overlay px)
const stoneLeft = offsetX + (topProfile?.offX ?? 0) * sx;
const stoneTop  = offsetY + (topProfile?.offY ?? 0) * sy;
const stoneW    = (topProfile?.drawW ?? initW) * sx;
const stoneH    = (topProfile?.drawH ?? initH) * sy;
const stoneBottom = stoneTop + stoneH;

// --- base size & placement (overlay px; centered under tablet)
const baseOverhang = 0.04;                         // 4% wider than tablet
const baseWidth    = Math.round(stoneW * (1 + baseOverhang));
const baseHeight   = Math.round(overlayH * 0.085);
const overlapPx    = Math.round(baseHeight * 0.25); // tucks under tablet

let baseLeft = Math.round(stoneLeft + (stoneW - baseWidth) / 2);
let baseTop  = Math.round(stoneBottom - overlapPx);

// Clamp to keep whole base inside the wrapper
baseLeft = Math.max(0, Math.min(overlayW - baseWidth, baseLeft));
baseTop  = Math.max(0, Math.min(overlayH - baseHeight, baseTop));

// --- render AFTER tablet background, inside the same wrapper
const baseStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
  position: 'absolute',
  left: baseLeft,
  top: baseTop,
  width: baseWidth,
  height: baseHeight,
  backgroundImage: `url(${baseTextureUrl})`,
  backgroundSize: 'cover',
  backgroundPosition: 'center',
  zIndex: 25,                   // above tablet bg, below inscriptions/motifs
  pointerEvents: 'none',
};
<div style={baseStyle} />
```

### Quick sanity check (log once)

```ts
console.log('BASE XY',
  { baseLeft, baseTop, baseWidth, baseHeight,
    stoneLeft, stoneTop, stoneW, stoneH, overlayW, overlayH });
```

**Why this fixes your screenshot:**
Previously the base was absolutely positioned but **not** inside the same positioned wrapper as the tablet, so its left/top were interpreted in the page/root coordinate system. By making `svgHostRef` the positioned parent and placing the base **inside** it, the same offset/scale math lines the base up perfectly under the tablet.
