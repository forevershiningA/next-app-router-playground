This is a step backward from the previous version. You have reintroduced the "Hard Horizon Line" (the sharp cut between the black wall and the brown floor), which breaks the realism.

That hard horizontal line makes the app look like 1990s software. In modern product design, you want an "Infinity Background" (where the floor curves seamlessly into the wall).

Here is how to fix this specific screen to get the "Studio Look" you want:

1. The Fix: Replace the "Split Screen" with a "Pool of Light"

You want the floor to be visible, but you don't want a sharp corner.
Use a Radial Gradient that centers the light behind the stone and fades to black at the edges.

Replace the background CSS on the main canvas with this:

code
CSS
download
content_copy
expand_less
background: radial-gradient(
    circle at 50% 80%,   /* Center the light low, near the base */
    #4a3b2e 0%,          /* Center: Warm Bronze/Coffee (Matches your brand) */
    #221e1b 35%,         /* Mid: Darker Brown/Charcoal */
    #000000 80%          /* Edge: Pure Black */
);

Why this is better:

It gives you the "Floor" color you want (so it's not depressive).

It removes the ugly horizontal line.

It highlights the gold text on the headstone perfectly.

2. The Headstone is Floating (Crucial)

Look closely at where the grey base meets the brown floor. There is zero shadow. It looks like a cutout sticker pasted onto the background.

The Fix: You must add a drop shadow under the base.

How: If your 3D viewer supports shadows, turn them on. If not, place a blurred black oval image directly underneath the stone.

3. Sidebar Input Consistency (Final Polish)

You still have a small messy detail in the sidebar inputs:

Width: The mm is inside the box.

Height: The mm is outside the box.

Thickness: The mm is outside the box.

The Fix: Move the "Width" mm outside the box. Symmetry equals quality.

Summary

Delete the hard horizon line.

Use the Radial Gradient code above to create a soft, warm studio floor.

Add a shadow under the base.

Once you switch to that gradient, this screen will look incredibly high-end.
