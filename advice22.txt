Based on the visual output and the provided code, the scene suffers from a common 3D issue: it looks "flat" and "gloomy" because the lighting is too even and the fog is too aggressive.

Here are the specific changes to improve the realism, emotional tone, and visual clarity of the scene.

1. Fix the "Gloomy" Atmosphere (Critical)

The Issue: The scene looks like a foggy morning in a horror movie rather than a peaceful tribute. The fog starts at distance 1 and ends at 4. Since the camera is likely 3-5 units away, the fog is washing out the colors of the headstone immediately.

The Fix: Push the fog back so the headstone sits in clear air, and only the distant horizon fades out.

Code Change:
In Scene.tsx, update the desktop fog settings:

code

// OLD
// : { near: 1, far: 4 };

// NEW (Push fog back significantly)
: { near: 15, far: 50 };
2. Fix Flat Lighting (Contrast & Depth)

The Issue: You have ambientLight set to 1.0. Ambient light creates no shadows; it flattens 3D objects. When Ambient is this high, the stone looks like a 2D sticker.

The Fix: Lower the ambient light to create darkness in the crevices, and rely on the Environment (HDRI) and SpotLight for the main illumination. This makes the gold engraving pop and the stone look polished.

Code Change:


{/* 1. AMBIENT: Lower this significantly to allow shadows to exist */}
<ambientLight intensity={0.3} color="#ffffff" /> 

{/* 2. ENVIRONMENT: Increase this slightly to get realistic reflections on the polished stone */}
<Environment ... environmentIntensity={0.8} />

{/* 3. SPOTLIGHT: Keep high intensity, but maybe warm it up slightly more */}
<spotLight 
  color="#fff5d1" // Warmer sun color
  intensity={2.5}
  ...
/>
3. Remove "Dust" Particles

The Issue: You are using <Sparkles />. While cool for fantasy games, in a product configurator for a headstone, floating particles often look like visual noise, glitches, or flies.

The Fix: Remove the component entirely for a cleaner, high-end look.
Code Change: Remove the <Sparkles /> block.

4. Improve the Floor/Grass

The Issue: The grass looks a bit generic and the "Contact Shadow" (the dark blob under the stone) is a bit too wide and blurry, making the stone look like it's floating slightly.

The Fix: Tighten the contact shadow to ground the stone firmly.

Code Change:


<ContactShadows
  scale={8} // Smaller scale to fit under the stone tighter
  blur={1.5} // Less blurry, more defined shadow
  opacity={0.7} // Darker shadow
  far={0.2} // Only calculate shadows very close to ground
  color="#000000"
/>
5. Color Palette Adjustment

The Issue: The sky is a pale blue/grey, and the grass is a deep green. The stone is black. The result is cold.

The Fix: Change the background gradient to a "Golden Hour" vibe. It feels more hopeful and premium.

Code Change (Inside GradientBackground):


// Change colors to a warm sunset/sunrise gradient
uniforms={{
  colorTop: { value: new THREE.Color('#6b95c0') }, // Deep calming blue
  colorBottom: { value: new THREE.Color('#e6d3a3') }, // Warm Horizon Gold
}}

Note: You will need to update your Fog color to match the new colorBottom (#e6d3a3).

Summary of Result

By making these changes, the stone will look like a solid, heavy object sitting in a peaceful, sunlit field. The text will be easier to read because the stone will be darker (due to lower ambient light) and the gold letters will catch the reflection of the brighter environment map.
