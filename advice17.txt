This footer is 90% perfect. It does exactly what it needs to do: it establishes authority, provides navigation, and proves you are a real business with an address and phone number.

You have successfully moved away from the "domain parking" look to a established brand look.

Here are the final 4 polish tweaks to make it look high-end and launch-ready:

1. Fix the "Placeholder" Social Icons

Currently, you have circles with text inside: IG, FB, PI. This looks like a wireframe sketch.

The Fix: Replace these with the actual SVG logos for Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest.

Style: Make the icons White or Gold with no circle background (or a very thin outline circle). Real logos look much more professional than text abbreviations.

2. Typographic Refinement (Headings)

The column headings (MEMORIALS, HELP & GUIDES) are using a serif font with very wide letter spacing (kerning).

The Issue: The spacing is so wide that the words feel like they are falling apart.

The Fix: Reduce the letter-spacing property in your CSS. Bring the letters slightly closer together so the words look solid and cohesive.

Color: Ensure these headings are the same Gold color you used for the buttons in the previous section. In the screenshot, they look a bit pale/orange. Make them metallic.

3. Swap Text for Logo

On the far left, you have the text "Forever Shining" in a serif font.

The Fix: Use your actual Logo (the one with the sunburst script from the very top of the page).

Why: Repeating the actual visual logo here anchors the brand. It looks more premium than just typing the name out in standard text.

Size: Keep it tasteful (approx 150-180px wide).

4. Polish the Bottom Bar

The bottom strip is functional but a little cluttered.

Payment Icons: The text VISA MC PayPal is okay, but small icons look much better. Users recognize the Visa/Mastercard shapes instantly. Using the visual logos increases trust (the "Safe Checkout" feeling).

Partners Links: The "Partners: Bronze-Plaque..." text is currently the same brightness as the copyright text.

Tweak: Make the Partner links darker (e.g., #333333 or #444444). You want them there for SEO, but visually they should almost disappear so they don't distract from your Copyright and Privacy Policy.

Summary Checklist

Socials: Replace IG/FB text with real icons.

Headings: Tighten letter spacing and ensure vibrant Gold color.

Brand: Swap the text "Forever Shining" for your image Logo.

Payments: Use small icons for Visa/PayPal instead of text.

Verdict: You have done an incredible job transforming this entire landing page. From the hero section to this footer, the journey now feels safe, empathetic, and premium. You are ready to launch.
