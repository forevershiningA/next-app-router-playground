This version is excellent. The removal of the sidebar makes the product feel premium, and the background blending is much smoother.

However, there are still a few sharp edges to polish. Here are the specific improvements needed for Visual Hierarchy, Grammar, and Code Quality.

1. Fix the Grammar (Immediate Fix)

In the sub-headline, you have a grammar mismatch (Singular "a" vs Plural "Headstones").

Current: "Create a beautiful, personalized Headstones and Cemetery Memorial Plaques."

Fix: "Create beautiful, personalized Headstones and Cemetery Memorial Plaques." (Remove "a").

2. Header & Logo Sizing (Critical Layout Fix)

Your logo is currently hard-coded to width: '400px'. On a mobile phone (which is usually ~375px wide), this will break the layout or cause horizontal scrolling. Also, the header feels unbalanced because there is nothing on the right side.

Change this block in your code:

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
{/* Logo - Fixed top-left position matching sidebar */}
<div className="fixed top-0 left-0 z-20 p-6" style={{ width: '400px' }}>
  <img src="/ico/forever-transparent-logo.png" ... />
</div>

To this (Responsive Header):

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
{/* Responsive Header */}
<header className="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-4">
  {/* Logo - Responsive width */}
  <div className="w-48 sm:w-64 md:w-80 transition-all">
    <img 
      src="/ico/forever-transparent-logo.png" 
      alt="Forever Shining - Design Online" 
      className="w-full h-auto drop-shadow-md" // Added shadow for readability
    />
  </div>

  {/* Top Right Navigation (Balances the logo) */}
  <nav className="hidden md:flex items-center gap-6">
    <Link href="/login" className="text-sm font-medium text-white hover:text-[#cfac6c] transition-colors">
      Login
    </Link>
    <Link 
      href="/contact" 
      className="rounded-full border border-white/20 bg-black/20 px-5 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-white backdrop-blur-sm transition-all hover:bg-white/10 hover:border-[#cfac6c]/50"
    >
      Contact Us
    </Link>
  </nav>
</header>
3. Improve the Rotation Controls

In the screenshot, the Left/Right arrows are grey/transparent and hard to see against the trees.

Fix: Increase the opacity of the button background and make the icon pure white with a glow.

Update your button classes:

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
className="... bg-black/40 border border-white/30 text-white hover:bg-[#cfac6c] hover:border-[#cfac6c] ..."

Changing the background to a dark semi-transparent black often contrasts better against bright nature backgrounds than a white semi-transparent background.

4. "How It Works" Section Polishing

The step indicators ("Step 1", "Step 2") intersect the border of the cards. In the screenshot, the border line runs through the text badge, which looks messy.

Fix: Add a background color to the "Step" badge that matches the page background to hide the border behind it, OR position it slightly differently.
Since your card background is #1A1A1A, ensure the badge has a distinct border or sits fully inside/outside the card.

5. Next.js Image Optimization

You are using standard <img> tags. Since this is Next.js, you should use the <Image /> component. This prevents layout shift (CLS) and automatically optimizes the logo size for mobile devices.

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
import Image from 'next/image';

// Inside your render
<Image 
  src="/ico/forever-transparent-logo.png" 
  alt="Forever Shining" 
  width={320} 
  height={100} 
  className="w-full h-auto"
  priority // Loads the logo immediately
/>
