The gold icons and the serif heading look much better—this section now feels like it belongs to the same brand as your Hero section.

To give it that final agency-level polish, focus on these four specific typographic and spacing refinements:

1. The "Boutique" Typography Trick

Currently, your card titles (e.g., "Multiple Shapes") use a bold sans-serif. While clear, it feels a bit "tech-heavy."

The Change: Change the Card Titles to the same Serif font you used for "Design Possibilities."

The Why: This creates a beautiful contrast between the "Classic/Elegant" titles and the "Modern/Clean" description text. It makes the features feel like crafted services rather than just software buttons.

2. Secondary Text Hierarchy

The description text is a bit bright, which makes it compete with the titles for attention.

The Change: Drop the opacity of the description text to about 75% white (or a light grey).

The Change: Increase the line-height (leading) of that text slightly.

The Why: This makes the titles "pop" more when scanning, and the extra line height makes the paragraphs feel more airy and easier to read.

3. Add a Subtle "Card Border"

Right now, the cards are just dark blocks on a dark background.

The Change: Add a very thin (1px) border to the cards. Don't use white; use a very dark gold or a deep grey.

The Change: Alternatively, add a subtle hover state where the border turns the brand gold when a user mouses over it.

The Why: This defines the space better and makes the interface feel "interactive" and high-end.

4. Background Glow (The "Halo")

The Change: Place a very large, extremely soft radial gradient (warm amber/brown) behind the entire grid of six cards.

The Why: This breaks up the flat black background and creates a "warmth" that ties back to the memorial theme. It prevents the site from feeling too "dark" or "heavy."

Visual Audit of the Content:

"Multiple Shapes": Great icon choice.

"Premium Materials": The pen icon is a bit small; you could try a "swatch" or "grid" icon to represent stone varieties.

"3D Preview": The eye icon is perfect.

One Final Polish Thought:
If you really want to wow users, place a small "Try the Designer" button at the very bottom of this section. After reading about all the "possibilities," you want to give them an immediate way to start exploring them.

Current Score: 8.5/10. These small typography and lighting tweaks will take it to a 10.
