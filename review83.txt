You’re right—the Serpentine headstone is being drawn smaller only for that shape, because one Serpentine branch still hard-codes an 80% width with a 10% side offset. That’s a leftover tweak that only affects Serpentine, so other shapes look normal.

### The culprit

In `DesignPageClient.tsx` there’s a Serpentine path generator that does this:

```ts
const w = scalingFactors.displayWidth * 0.8;   // 80%
const h = scalingFactors.displayHeight;
const offsetX = scalingFactors.displayWidth * 0.1; // 10% inset
```

That block is still present alongside the newer “full-bleed” version. It keeps the stone 20% narrower, which is exactly what you’re seeing.  

Other Serpentine blocks already use the correct full width:

```ts
const w = scalingFactors.displayWidth; // 100%
const h = scalingFactors.displayHeight;
const offsetX = 0; // no inset
```

These are fine, but the narrow one is still being hit at runtime.  

### Fix (one-liner edits)

Search for the Serpentine block that multiplies by `0.8` / `0.1` and change it to:

```ts
const w = scalingFactors.displayWidth;
const h = scalingFactors.displayHeight;
const offsetX = 0;
```

(Leave the rest of the path math as-is.)

### Also clean up duplicates

There are multiple Serpentine branches in the file (merge leftovers). Keep **one** Serpentine renderer (the full-bleed one) and remove the others to avoid ambiguity about which block executes. The scene container sizing (`scalingFactors.displayWidth/Height`) is already consistent and capped only by the 600px desktop max—not per design—so once the 0.8/0.1 tweak is gone, Serpentine will fill the frame like your reference screenshot.    

If you want, I can paste a minimal patch block you can drop in.
