Looking tight—nice work. The spray now tracks the curve cleanly and the overall layout matches the reference. A few quick polish items to make this bullet-proof across shapes and devices:

1. Shoulder-aware snap
   Right now we treat the whole “top band” the same. On Ogee/Serpentine, shoulders have steeper slopes. Compute the local slope from `topY` and reduce the snap strength or increase `marginPx` when `|dy/dx| > 0.6` to keep birds/leaves off the bevel.

2. Side inset as %
   Make `sideInsetPx` proportional so it scales with canvases:
   `const sideInsetPx = Math.round(initW * 0.018); // ~1.8%`

3. Fallback path
   If `topProfile` isn’t ready (slow network / SVG fetch), use your vPad nudge for top motifs so placement never “floats” lower than expected.

4. Save-back mapping
   When users drag a snapped motif, persist **authoring** coords using the *adjusted* `cyUsed` so re-opened designs look identical (no re-snap drift).

5. Performance (bigger designs)

* Cache `buildTopProfile` by an SVG hash (viewBox + path length) to avoid recompute between re-renders.
* Sample every 2 px when scanning: iterate `x += 2`, then linear-interpolate missing columns—cuts `getImageData` work ~50% with no visible change.
* Optional: move the profile build into a Web Worker so it never blocks the main thread.

6. Mobile drag polish
   Switch to Pointer Events + capture, and set `touch-action: none` on the draggable to eliminate browser pan interference during fine placement.

7. Surname safety cap (optional but useful)
   Add the bounding box check you noted so top motifs keep a small gap (8–12 px) from the surname baseline, especially on tight arcs.

If you want, I can stitch #1, #2, and the fallback guard directly into your current `DesignPageClient.tsx` where you log `MOTIF v42`—the rest can be incremental.
