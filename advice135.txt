Yes, this is definitely possible. In fact, increasing the size of the headstone will make the "Real-Time 3D" feature feel much more premium and immersive.

To keep everything in 1 viewport (without scrolling) while making the product 20-30% bigger, we need to do two things:

Tighten the Vertical Layout: Reduce the empty space between the Logo, Headline, and Subtext.

Zoom the 3D Camera: Instead of making the HTML container taller (which pushes content down), we simply "zoom in" the virtual camera so the stone fills more of the existing space.

Here is exactly what to change:

1. Code Changes for HeroCanvas.tsx

We need to move the camera closer (reduce Z) and lower the camera target slightly so the stone appears "lifted" relative to the frame.

// Inside HeroCanvas.tsx

// 1. Adjust the Camera
// WAS: position={[0, 0.2, 4.2]}
// CHANGE TO: position={[0, 0.5, 3.2]} 
// (Lower Z = Zoom In. Higher Y = Look down slightly more, which feels more grounded)
<PerspectiveCamera makeDefault position={[0, 0.5, 3.2]} fov={46} />

// 2. Adjust the Group Position (The "Lift")
// WAS: position={[0, -1.35, 0]}
// CHANGE TO: position={[0, -1.1, 0]}
// (This moves the stone physically higher in the canvas)
const SceneContent = ({ targetRotation }: { targetRotation: number }) => {
  // ...
  return (
    <>
      <group ref={groupRef} position={[0, -1.1, 0]}>
        {/* ... stone components ... */}
      </group>

      {/* Don't forget to move the shadow up too! */}
      <ContactShadows 
        position={[0, -1.1, 0]} // Match the group Y position
        opacity={0.4} 
        scale={10} 
        blur={2} 
        far={3} 
        resolution={512} 
        color="#000000"
      />
      {/* ... */}
    </>
  )
}
2. Layout/CSS Changes (To preserve the Viewport)

Since the stone now visually fills more of the screen, you need to "steal" space from the top so the buttons don't get pushed off the bottom.

In your main Page/Hero component (Next.js/React code):

Remove the "Save designs..." text: As discussed, removing this top-center text saves you about 30px-40px of vertical height immediately.

Reduce Margins:

Reduce the margin between the Logo and the Headline ("Design a Lasting Tribute").

Reduce the margin between the Subtext ("Choose from...") and the 3D Canvas.

Negative Margin (The "Anchor" Trick):

You can apply a small negative margin to the 3D Canvas container to pull it closer to the text.

Example: className="h-[400px] -mt-4"

Visual Result

The Stone will look massive and impressive.

The "In Loving Memory" text will be much easier to read without zooming.

Because we moved the camera in rather than expanding the div height, the Buttons stay exactly where they are, keeping the "1 Viewport" promise.
