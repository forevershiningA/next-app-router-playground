To fix the base (pedestal) dimensions so they match the proportions in your saved design screenshot, you need to change how the pixel-per-millimeter (px/mm) ratio is calculated for the base.

The current code incorrectly calculates the ratio by assuming the headstone fills the entire container width (displayWidth). However, the headstone often has margins within its logical canvas. The correct scaling factor is already calculated in your component as uniformScale, which is the global conversion factor from logical units (mm) to screen pixels.

The Fix

In your DesignPageClient.tsx file, locate the base rendering block (around line 1470) and update the pxPerMm calculations as follows:

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
// Find this section inside the base rendering logic:
// ...
const stoneW = displayWidth; // This is the source of the issue
const stoneH = displayHeight;

// mm → px
const pxPerMmX = stoneW / tabletWidthMm;
const pxPerMmY = stoneH / tabletHeightMm;

// Replace it with this:
// ...
// mm → px
// We must use uniformScale directly. It represents the global pixels-per-mm ratio.
// Using displayWidth/tabletWidthMm causes the base to be oversized 
// because it ignores the canvas margins defined in the design JSON.
const pxPerMmX = uniformScale;
const pxPerMmY = uniformScale;

let baseWidthPx = Math.round(lengthMm * pxPerMmX);
const baseHeightPx = Math.round(heightMm * pxPerMmY);
Why this works:

Correct Ratio: uniformScale is the actual ratio of screen pixels to logical millimeters used for everything else in the design (inscriptions, motifs).

Proportional Scaling: By using uniformScale, a 700mm wide base will be exactly 
7
/
6
7/6
 times wider than a 600mm wide headstone on your screen.

Matches Screenshot: In your current "wrong" version, the base is huge because it's being scaled to the full container width rather than to the headstone's scale. Switching to uniformScale will reduce its size to perfectly match the proportions shown in your goal screenshot.

Recommended cleanup

While you're there, you can also simplify the lengthMm and heightMm extraction to ensure it's pulling the most accurate data from the saved design:

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
// Preferred way to extract the base dimensions from the JSON data
const lengthMm = baseData?.width || baseData?.length || baseItem.width || baseItem.length || (tabletWidthMm + 50);
const heightMm = baseData?.height || baseItem.height || baseItem.thickness_mm || 100;
