This is getting very close to a professional finish. The lighting on the top of the heart helps it feel 3D, and the layout is much cleaner without the top-left clutter.

However, there is one major visual glitch and two subtle polish details remaining that prevent this from looking "real."

1. Fix the "Black Box" at the Bottom (Critical)

Look at the bottom of the heart stone. There is a large, solid black rectangle obscuring the bottom of the image. It looks like a mistake or a masking error.

The Issue: It cuts the heart shape off unnaturally. Headstones don't just "end" in a straight line; they usually sit on a rectangular stone base (a plinth).

The Fix:

Show the Base: If possible, your 3D render should include the rectangular base that the heart sits on. This "grounds" the object.

Remove the Mask: If you don't have a base, remove that hard horizontal black line. Let the heart shape fade out softly at the bottom, or show the full shape.

2. Add "Texture" (Not Just Gradient)

The lighting you added (the shine on top) is a great start, but currently, the stone looks like smooth plastic because it is a solid color.

The Fix: Granite has "grain" or speckles.

How to fake it: Overlay a very subtle "noise" or "grain" texture on the heart shape. It shouldn't be just grey; it should be "Glory Black Granite" (which has tiny flecks). This micro-texture signals "Premium Stone" to the brain.

3. Clean Up the "Pill" Labels

The two labels at the bottom of the stone (Style: Heart and Material: Glory Black) are floating awkwardly above that black box.

The Fix: Merge them or simplify them.

Current: [ STYLE: HEART ] [ MATERIAL: GLORY BLACK ]

Better: "Heart Shape • Glory Black Granite"

Placement: Place this text simply and cleanly below the stone image (in the space where the black box currently is), rather than overlapping the image.

4. Typography Hierarchy

The text "In our hearts you live forever" is very large. In design, smaller is often more elegant.

The Fix: Reduce the size of the quote by about 20%. Give it more breathing room inside the heart. This makes it look precious rather than crowded.

Summary of Final Polish

Remove the black rectangle obscuring the bottom of the stone.

Add a rectangular base to the stone render so it feels grounded.

Add subtle grain/texture to the grey surface so it looks like rock, not plastic.

Shrink the gold text slightly for elegance.

Once you fix that bottom "cutoff" issue, this section is ready to ship.
