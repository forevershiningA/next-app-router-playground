You have created what is known in 3D modeling as the "Dried Mud" or "Turtle Shell" effect.

Your geometry is perfect (the rounded corners are great), but the texture map you are using is a "Voronoi" or "Cellular" pattern.

The problem: This pattern creates flat islands separated by deep cracks.

The reality: Rock pitch (chipped granite) has no flat spots. It is jagged and sharp everywhere. It should look like a mountain range, not a stone walkway.

Here is how to fix this for the final photorealistic look:

1. The Texture Swap (The "Asphalt" Trick)

Stop looking for "Rock" textures. Most "Rock" textures in libraries look like cliffs or cobblestones (like what you have now).

The Secret: Use a "Rough Asphalt" or "Rough Concrete" Normal Map.
When you take a texture of rough road asphalt and scale it up, it looks exactly like chipped granite. It provides that uniform, sharp, grainy roughness without the big "turtle shell" cracks.

Search for: Asphalt Normal Map or Rough Concrete Normal Map.

2. Make the Texture Smaller (Increase Repeat)

Currently, your "stones" are huge. If that base is 6 inches tall, those cracked sections are 2 inches wide. That is too big for a chisel mark.

You need to increase the tiling (repeat) significantly to make the grain finer.

// If your base width is 10 and height is 2...
// Try high numbers to make the grain fine and sharp.
material.normalMap.repeat.set(15, 3);
3. Lower the "Normal Scale" Intensity

Right now, your cracks are pitch black. This means your normalScale is set too high (maybe 3 or 4), making the computer think the cracks are inches deep.

Lower it to make the surface look rough, but not "cracked."

const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    color: 0x222222,
    normalMap: asphaltNormalMap, // <--- Swap the image file!
    
    // Lower this. 
    // (1, 1) is standard. (1.5, 1.5) is rough. 
    // (3, 3) creates the black cracks you have now.
    normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(1.5, 1.5), 
    
    roughness: 0.7
});
Summary

Delete that "Cellular/Cracked" texture. It will never look like pitch.

Load an "Asphalt" or "Noise" Normal Map.

Repeat the texture more (make the grain smaller).

You are essentially just one image file away from perfect realism.
