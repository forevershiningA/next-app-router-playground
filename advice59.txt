This is a major improvement. You’ve addressed the most critical usability issues: precision (via text inputs), context (via min/max labels), and clarity (via icons and better contrast).

Here are a few "fine-tuning" suggestions to take it from good to professional-grade:

1. Logical Hierarchy & Spacing

The top row (Add Base, Upright, Slant) is getting a bit "busy." You have three different types of interactions happening in one tight line: a checkbox, a radio button, and icons.

Suggestion: Group the Upright/Slant choice separately from the Add Base toggle.

Why: Selecting the "style" (Upright vs. Slant) feels like a primary choice for the headstone itself, whereas "Add Base" feels like an optional add-on.

2. The "Tab vs. Checkbox" Conflict

There is still some potential confusion with having both an "Add Base" checkbox and a "Base" tab at the top.

The Problem: What happens if I click the "Base" tab but haven't checked "Add Base"? Does it check it automatically? What if I uncheck "Add Base" while on the "Base" tab?

The Fix: Consider removing the "Add Base" checkbox entirely. Instead, put a "No Base / Add Base" toggle inside the Base tab, or simply have the Base tab "active" by default with an option to remove it. This simplifies the interface.

3. Icon Visibility & Polish

Icon Size: The icons for Upright and Slant are a bit thin and small. Making them slightly larger or using solid "silhouette" versions would make them more glanceable.

Input Box Alignment: The numeric values (620, 600, 100) look slightly off-center vertically inside their boxes. Centering them perfectly will make the UI feel more "stable."

"mm" Proximity: Move the "mm" label closer to the input box. Currently, there’s a lot of dead space between the box and the unit, which can make them feel disconnected on wider screens.

4. Semantic Grouping (Visual Dividers)

Add a very subtle horizontal line (a "rule") between the style selection (Upright/Slant) and the dimensions (Width/Height).

Why: It helps the user mentally switch from "What shape am I making?" to "How big is it?"

5. Interaction Hint: The "Active" State

Since you have both a slider and a text box, ensure they stay perfectly in sync.

Visual feedback: When a user clicks into a text box, consider giving the box a gold border to show it is the "active" focus point.

Overall, you've moved from a "guessing tool" to a "precision tool." The current version is much more user-friendly for someone actually trying to order or design a specific product.
