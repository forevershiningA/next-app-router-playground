Audit Report: ThreeScene.tsx
Overview
ThreeScene
 is the main entry point for the 3D canvas. It manages the camera, view mode (2D/3D), loading states, and WebGL context lifecycle.

Findings
1. Unused Import
Location: Line 9 (CanvasClickOverlay).
Issue: Imported but never used in the component.
Recommendation: Remove the import.
2. Camera Logic Discrepancy
Location: Lines 20-63 (
CameraController
).
Issue:
The useEffect (Lines 24-35) sets the controls target to 
(0, 4.2, 0)
 for both 2D and 3D modes.
The 2D camera (Line 44) is positioned at 4.2 + ... in Y.
The 3D camera (Line 57) is positioned at 4.8 in Y.
Observation: The target 4.2 seems to be the "center of attention".
Redundancy: The useEffect has an if/else block that does the exact same thing in both branches:
if (is2DMode) {
  (controls as any).target.set(0, 4.2, 0);
  // ...
} else {
  (controls as any).target.set(0, 4.2, 0);
  // ...
}
Recommendation: Simplify the effect to remove the redundant conditional.
3. Hardcoded Styles
Location: Lines 204-207.
style={{ 
  height: '100vh',
  maxWidth: '1200px',
  margin: '0 auto',
  padding: '10%'
}}
Issue: Inline styles mixed with Tailwind classes (className="relative w-full ...").
Recommendation: Move these to Tailwind classes if possible (e.g., h-screen max-w-[1200px] mx-auto p-[10%]) for consistency.
4. 
ProductNameHeader
 Placement
Location: Lines 83-106.
Issue: This component renders HTML text inside the 
ThreeScene
 component but outside the Canvas.
Observation: It uses absolute positioning.
Status: Acceptable, but ensure it doesn't block canvas interaction (it has pointer-events-none, so it's good).
5. WebGL Context Loss Handling
Location: Lines 230-243.
Observation: Good practice to handle context loss.
Note: gl.dispose?.() in cleanup (Line 137) is a good safety measure, though React Three Fiber usually handles this.
Action Plan
Remove Unused Import: Delete CanvasClickOverlay.
Simplify Camera Logic: Merge the if/else in 
CameraController
 effect.
Refactor Styles: Convert inline styles to Tailwind classes.
