This is a great start—the layout is clean, the hierarchy is clear, and the serif typography fits the somber and respectful nature of the industry.

However, because you are selling a "beautiful, personalized memorial," the current hero section feels a bit too dark and clinical. The pitch-black headstone feels like a "void" rather than a premium product.

Here are a few ideas to elevate the design and make it feel more high-end and comforting:

1. Show the "3D" and "Personalized" Aspect

The text mentions a "3D design system" and "hundreds of options," but the image shows a generic black shape.

Add Texture: Replace the flat black with a realistic granite or marble texture (e.g., Blue Pearl, India Red, or classic Grey Granite).

Add a Sample Inscription: Don’t leave it blank. Use a tasteful placeholder name (e.g., "In Loving Memory of Jonathan Doe") in a beautiful engraved font. This helps the user visualize the final result immediately.

Show Depth: Adjust the lighting on the 3D model to highlight the polished edges. This proves the "3D" claim.

2. Warm up the Atmosphere

The current background is very dark and cold. This can feel "heavy" to someone already grieving.

Subtle Background Imagery: Instead of a flat gradient, use a very high-focal-length (blurred) photo of a peaceful, sun-drenched park or a quiet memorial garden.

Lighting Effects: Add a subtle "god ray" or a soft golden light source coming from the top corner. This shifts the mood from "death/void" to "legacy/memory."

3. Improve the Call to Action (CTA)

Interactive Preview: If possible, make the 3D model slightly rotatable via mouse hover. This immediately demonstrates the "interactive 3D" value proposition mentioned in the subheadline.

Button Contrast: Your "Start Designing" button is gold, which is good. Ensure the "Browse Designs" button doesn't get lost. You might try making "Browse Designs" a text link with an arrow if you want to focus 100% of the attention on the builder.

4. Refine the Typography

Headline Polish: The headline is quite long. You might try breaking it into two lines with different weights:

Design Your Own (Thin Serif)

HEADSTONES & MEMORIALS (Bold Serif)

Trust Signals: Below the buttons, add a tiny line of text or icons: "Over 50 stone types available" or "Trusted by 5,000+ families." This builds immediate credibility.

5. Layout Variation: The "Split" Hero

Right now, everything is centered. A common high-end e-commerce layout is:

Left Side: Text, Subtext, and CTA buttons.

Right Side: A larger, high-detail 3D render of a completed headstone with flowers next to it.

Benefit: This creates a more balanced, "lifestyle" feel rather than a "software" feel.

Summary of the "Vibe" shift:

Current Vibe: "A software tool for grave markers."

Target Vibe: "A respectful way to craft a beautiful, lasting legacy."

Quickest win: Add a realistic granite texture and a sample name to the headstone. It will immediately look 10x more professional.
