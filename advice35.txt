You *are* computing the slant and even building a quaternion—but it’s never applied. In **react-three-fiber** the `quaternion` prop expects a `THREE.Quaternion` object, not a `[x,y,z,w]` tuple. You’re passing an array, so the wrapper never rotates, which is why the inscriptions/motifs still look upright.

Do these two surgical fixes:

### 1) Keep a real `THREE.Quaternion` and pass it directly

Change the types you return from the big `useMemo` and stop converting to an array.

```ts
// return shape (types changed)
return {
  // ...
  childWrapperPos: [0, 0, (depth / 2) * scale * sCore] as [number, number, number],
  childWrapperRotation: wrapperQuaternion as THREE.Quaternion
};
```

And where you declare the default for the non-slant branch:

```ts
childWrapperRotation: new THREE.Quaternion(), // identity
```

In JSX:

```tsx
<group
  ref={scaledWrapperRef}
  position={childWrapperPos}
  quaternion={childWrapperRotation}   // <-- pass the object, not an array
>
  <group scale={meshScale}>
    {typeof children === 'function' && children(childApi, selectedAdditions)}
  </group>
</group>
```

### 2) Fix the normal sign used to build that quaternion

Your current normal uses `sin(-slantAngleRad)`, which tilts it the wrong way. Use a positive angle about **+X**:

```ts
const slantAngleRad = Math.atan2(frontTopZOffset, height_svg_units);

// outward normal of the polished face
const frontNormal = new THREE.Vector3(0, Math.sin(slantAngleRad), Math.cos(slantAngleRad)).normalize();

// align local +Z to that normal
const wrapperQuaternion = new THREE.Quaternion()
  .setFromUnitVectors(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 1), frontNormal);
```

That’s it. With a real quaternion applied (and the correct sign), the child wrapper’s local **+Z** becomes the face normal, so all inscriptions/motifs/additions that you place at `z = api.frontZ` will sit flush and visibly match the slant. If anything still looks “upright,” scan the child components for `billboard`, `lookAt`, or code that resets `rotation/quaternion` each frame, and remove it for these meshes.
