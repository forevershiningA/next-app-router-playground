You are extremely close, but that hard horizontal line cutting the screen in half is killing the realism. It makes the 3D model look like it's sitting on a cardboard box instead of a showroom floor.

Here is the final polish to blend that floor seamlessly and make it look like a high-end studio.

1. The Fix: Switch to a Radial Gradient (The "Infinity Floor")

You currently have a sharp split: Black top, Brown bottom.
You need a Radial Gradient. This simulates a spotlight hitting the floor behind the object, fading smoothly into the darkness.

Replace the background CSS of the canvas with this:

code
CSS
download
content_copy
expand_less
background: radial-gradient(
    ellipse at 50% 80%,   /* Position the light low, near the base */
    #4a3b2e 0%,           /* Center: Warm Bronze/Coffee (The floor color you want) */
    #2a221b 40%,          /* Mid: Darker Brown */
    #000000 80%           /* Edge: Pure Black */
);

Why this works:

No Hard Edge: It removes that ugly line that cuts through the screen.

Studio Feel: It looks like a curved "infinity wall" used in professional photography.

Warmth: You get that nice brown floor color to lift the mood, but it feels natural.

2. Ground the Object (The Shadow)

Look at the bottom corners of the grey base. They look like they are floating.

The Fix: You must add a drop shadow under the base.

How: If your 3D engine allows it, enable "Contact Shadows" or "Ambient Occlusion."

Cheat: If you can't render real shadows, place a blurred black oval image (.png) directly underneath the 3D model.

3. Hide the Wireframe

That faint yellow/white box surrounding the headstone is still visible.

The Fix: Hide the bounding box wireframe. Only show it if the user is actively resizing. It ruins the photo-realistic look.

Summary

The sidebar is perfect (great job moving the mm outside the box!).
The only thing left is to change that background to a Radial Gradient to soften the floor. Do that, and you are finished.
