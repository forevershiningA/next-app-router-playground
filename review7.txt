You’re right – this one got broken by the recent changes.

### What’s going wrong

In **`DesignPageClient.tsx`** the main headstone container was changed to a *square* box based on `initW`:

```tsx
<div 
  className="relative"
  style={{
    width: `${scalingFactors.initW * scalingFactors.uniformScale}px`,
    height: `${scalingFactors.initW * scalingFactors.uniformScale}px` // Square container
  }}
>
```

But:

* The **authoring frame is not square** (e.g. 707×476 for desktop, 414×660 for iPhone).
* We’re already using `uniformScale` inside the container (for inscriptions/motifs) to map from authoring space → display space.
* For tall designs like your PINTO Curved Gable, forcing a square container plus extra scaling makes the whole layout drift and crop differently on desktop vs iPhone (DPR 3).

So the coordinates and fonts are being scaled **twice in one axis and inconsistently in the other**, which is why the SEHOVIC/PINTO designs are suddenly “all over the place”.

---

### Fix

Make the headstone container match the **actual display dimensions** (respecting aspect ratio and all the DPR/container logic you already calculated), and let `uniformScale` handle the authoring-space scaling inside.

Replace this block in **`DesignPageClient.tsx`**:

```tsx
{/* Headstone SVG as the main shape with texture overlay */}
{/* Container sized to match SVG - make it square based on width to prevent distortion */}
<div 
  className="relative"
  style={{
    width: `${scalingFactors.initW * scalingFactors.uniformScale}px`,
    height: `${scalingFactors.initW * scalingFactors.uniformScale}px` // Square container
  }}
>
```

with:

```tsx
{/* Headstone SVG as the main shape with texture overlay */}
{/* Container follows display dimensions (no forced square) */}
<div
  className="relative"
  style={{
    width: `${scalingFactors.displayWidth}px`,
    height: `${scalingFactors.displayHeight}px`,
    maxWidth: '100%',
  }}
>
```

Everything else in that section (SVG rendering, inscriptions layer with
`transform: scale(scalingFactors.uniformScale)`, motifs, etc.) can stay as is.

### What this change does

* Uses your **computed `displayWidth`/`displayHeight`** (already DPR- & viewport-aware) as the true canvas size.
* Keeps **authoring coordinates** (from the XML) in the right proportion on both desktop and mobile.
* Removes the square-box distortion that was pushing PINTO / SEHOVIC text off-center.

After this change, reloading the PINTO design (both on desktop and in the iPhone 14 Pro Max emulator) should show:

* Top surname centered over the curved gable.
* Epitaph and two name blocks correctly aligned and readable.
* Motifs and Madonna motif in the right relative positions.
