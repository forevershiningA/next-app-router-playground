# Select Size

The size of headstones range from 300mm ~ 1200mm in width &amp; height in 1mm increments. The thickness> of the headstone depends on the width & height of the headstone. As examples, 300mm square will be 40mm thick, 600mm square will be 60mm thick, and 1200mm square will be 100mm thick. Please be aware that cemeteries often have regulations on allowable dimensions including thickness of memorials.

We can produce headstones bigger and thicker than is possible using the DYO design system. Please call us if the online DYO system does not offer the size of headstone you would like.
