Yep — it’s still not visible because **the bad Z block is still in your file** and it’s pushing the statue *behind / out of view*.

In `/mnt/data/AdditionModel.tsx` you currently still have this for statues/vases:

```ts
const baseDepth = baseBBox.max.z - baseBBox.min.z;
const centerOffset = -baseDepth / 2;
const statueHalfDepth = actualDepth / 2;

zPosition = surfaceZ + centerOffset + statueHalfDepth;
```

### Why this makes the statue disappear

* `surfaceZ` is in **headstone-local space** (you computed it using `stone.worldToLocal(...)`)
* `baseDepth` is in **base-local space** (from `baseMesh.geometry.boundingBox`)
* You’re mixing spaces, so `centerOffset` is nonsense in headstone space → huge wrong shift → statue vanishes.

---

## ✅ The correct Z calculation (use ONE coordinate space)

You already fixed `baseSurfaceZ` to be the **top-front** of the base *in headstone space*:

```ts
const topFrontPoint = new THREE.Vector3(0, targetBBox.max.y, targetBBox.max.z);
const worldTopFront = baseMesh.localToWorld(topFrontPoint.clone());
return stone.worldToLocal(worldTopFront.clone()).z;
```

That means:

* `baseSurfaceZ` is the **front plane** of the base (in headstone space)
* To keep the statue sitting *on* the base (not hanging off the front), you want the statue center moved **back by half its depth**.

### Replace your entire statue/vase Z block with this:

```ts
const MARGIN = 0.01; // 10mm in meters

if (addition.type === 'application') {
  zPosition = surfaceZ + actualDepth / 2 + APPLICATION_Z_OFFSET;
} else {
  // statues/vases
  if (offset.targetSurface === 'base' && baseSurfaceZ !== null) {
    // baseSurfaceZ = base front plane (in headstone space)
    zPosition = baseSurfaceZ - actualDepth / 2 - MARGIN;
  } else {
    // if ever placed on headstone surface, keep it in front
    zPosition = headFrontZ + actualDepth / 2;
  }
}
```

**Important:** delete the `baseDepth / centerOffset` logic completely.

## Quick sanity check (so you know it will show)

Temporarily force:

```ts
zPosition = headFrontZ + 0.2;
```

If you still can’t see it after that, then it’s not Z — it’s likely **scale became tiny** or the model got rotated/translated into the headstone.

But in your case, the Z mix-up is enough to make it disappear.

If you paste your console log of:

* `headFrontZ`
* `baseSurfaceZ`
* `actualDepth`
* `zPosition`

…I’ll confirm the sign (+/-) is correct for your camera direction, but the fix above is the correct coordinate-space-safe formula.
