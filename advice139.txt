The Final Polish: "Rim Lighting"
The only remaining visual issue is that the black stone is blending into the dark blue background. It looks a little flat.
To make the 3D really "pop" and look professional, you should add a Rim Light (a light from behind). This will create a thin white outline along the edges of the stone, separating it from the background.
Here is the code to add that light in HeroCanvas.tsx:
code
Tsx
{/* Inside the <Canvas> component in HeroCanvas.tsx */}

<ambientLight intensity={0.5} />

{/* 1. NEW: Rim Light (Backlight) - Separates stone from background */}
<spotLight 
  position={[-5, 5, -5]} // Behind and to the left
  angle={0.5}
  intensity={3} // High intensity to catch the edge
  color="#ffffff" 
  castShadow={false}
/>

{/* Existing Key Light */}
<spotLight 
  position={[8, 8, 8]} 
  // ... existing props ...
/>
What this will do:
It will catch the bevels and curves on the left/top edge of the headstone, creating a crisp highlight that defines the shape against the dark sky.
