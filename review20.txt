Yep—your text & motifs are still being sized with a **different scale** than their positions.

Right now positions use `uniformScale`, but sizes use a second scale (`displayScale`). When those differ even a little (container/padding, flex centering, cropping, etc.), everything renders too small. You can see `displayScale` being computed off the DOM width and then applied to font/motif sizes, while positions keep using `uniformScale`.   

### Quick fix (single-scale everywhere)

Use **only** `uniformScale` for both positions **and** sizes, and delete `displayScale` entirely.

1. **Remove `displayScale` state & effect**

* Delete the state (`const [displayScale, setDisplayScale] = useState(1);`) and the “📐 Display scale calculated” effect where it’s set from `getBoundingClientRect()` (appears multiple times in the file). 

2. **Inscriptions — size with `uniformScale`**
   Find the inscription sizing block and change:

```ts
// before
const fontSize = canvasFontSize * displayScale;
```

to:

```ts
// after
const fontSize = canvasFontSize * uniformScale;
```

(Leave the DPR normalization step as is.) 

3. **Motifs — size with `uniformScale`**
   In the motif sizing block, change both width & height paths:

```ts
// before
let motifHeight = motifHeightCanvas
  ? motifHeightCanvas * displayScale
  : (svgDims ? svgDims.height * motifRatio * displayScale : 100 * displayScale);

let motifWidth = motifHeightCanvas
  ? motifHeightCanvas * aspect * displayScale
  : (svgDims ? svgDims.width * motifRatio * displayScale : 100 * displayScale);
```

to:

```ts
// after
let motifHeight = motifHeightCanvas
  ? motifHeightCanvas * uniformScale
  : (svgDims ? svgDims.height * motifRatio * uniformScale : 100 * uniformScale);

let motifWidth = motifHeightCanvas
  ? motifHeightCanvas * aspect * uniformScale
  : (svgDims ? svgDims.width * motifRatio * uniformScale : 100 * uniformScale);
```



That’s it. Positions and sizes are now on the **same** authoring-frame → display mapping (`uniformScale`), so the inscriptions/motifs will match the original layout.

> Bonus sanity check: log `uniformScale` and (temporarily) the old `displayScale` once—if they weren’t identical, that mismatch is exactly why everything looked small. 

If you still see drift after this, the next suspect is duplicate/older blocks of the same component logic in this file (there are repeated sections). Make sure only one active preview/render path remains so you’re not mixing two implementations.
