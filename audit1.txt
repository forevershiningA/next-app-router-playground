Refactor InscriptionOverlayPanel
Goal Description
Audit and clean up 
app/inscriptions/InscriptionOverlayPanel.tsx
. The audit revealed:

Unused products prop.
Duplicate useEffect hook.
Unused FONT_FILE_MAP constant.
Unnecessary database call in the parent layout (
app/with-scene/inscriptions/layout.tsx
) which fetches data only to pass it to the unused prop.
This refactor will improve code quality, reduce bundle size slightly, and improve performance by removing a server-side DB call.

User Review Required
NOTE

I am removing an artificial delay in preloadFont (or arguably keeping it if you prefer smoothness over speed, but I will prioritize cleanup). Actually, looking at the code, the delay is minimal/debounced, I will leave the UX logic as is unless asked, focusing on dead code. Update: I will leave the font loading UX as is, only cleaning dead code.

Verification Plan
Automated Tests
Run build to ensure no TypeScript errors: npm run build (or npx tsc --noEmit).
Manual Verification
Navigate to /inscriptions (or where this panel is active).
Open the Inscription panel.
Verify fonts still load (testing preloadFont).
Verify text updates work (testing the remaining useEffect logic).
Verify no console errors regarding missing props.
