Good — this is a classic coordinate-frame mismatch problem. Let’s break it down cleanly and mechanically.

From your render:

* The base (plinth) is long in X
* Depth appears to be Z
* Height is Y (as expected in three.js / R3F)

So we’re working in a standard Three.js world:

```
X = left/right
Y = up/down
Z = forward/back
```

## 1️⃣ What’s Currently Wrong

From the screenshot, the statue is:

* Sitting on the **far right end of the base**
* Slightly offset visually
* Likely positioned using the base’s *center* as reference
* And likely not accounting for:

  * Base half-depth
  * Statue bounding box height
  * Statue pivot origin (VERY important)

### The real issue

Your statue’s `position.z` is probably being set like this:

```ts
statue.position.z = baseDepth / 2
```

But that assumes:

* Base origin is centered
* Statue origin is centered
* Statue origin is at its bottom

And that last one is almost never true.

Most models have:

* Pivot at center
* Or pivot at 0,0,0 from Blender
* Or pivot at feet but not guaranteed

So visually:

The statue is likely:

* Floating slightly
* Or clipping
* Or not perfectly aligned to the top of the base

---

## 2️⃣ Where It Should Be

Let’s define proper placement mathematically.

Assume:

```
Base:
width  = baseWidth
height = baseHeight
depth  = baseDepth

Statue:
bbox = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(statue)
statueHeight = bbox.max.y - bbox.min.y
statueDepth  = bbox.max.z - bbox.min.z
```

---

### ✅ Correct Y Placement (Height)

The statue should sit ON TOP of the base:

If base is centered at Y=0:

```
base top = baseHeight / 2
```

Statue must be lifted by:

```
statueY = baseHeight / 2 - bbox.min.y
```

That accounts for the statue pivot not being at the feet.

This is the most common thing people miss.

---

### ✅ Correct Z Placement (Front/Back)

If the base is centered at 0:

```
base front face = baseDepth / 2
```

To place statue centered on depth:

```
statueZ = 0
```

To place statue near front edge:

```
statueZ = baseDepth / 2 - statueDepth / 2 - margin
```

To place statue at rear edge:

```
statueZ = -baseDepth / 2 + statueDepth / 2 + margin
```

Right now you likely used:

```
statueZ = baseDepth / 2
```

Which puts the statue’s center at the edge, meaning half of it hangs off.

---

### ✅ Correct X Placement (Left/Right)

If centered:

```
statueX = 0
```

If placed to the right:

```
statueX = baseWidth / 2 - statueWidth / 2 - margin
```

---

## 3️⃣ The Fundamental Mistake

The mistake is almost always this:

❌ Using base dimensions directly
instead of
✅ Using half-dimensions and statue bounding box dimensions.

And especially:

❌ Not compensating for `bbox.min.y`

That causes floating / sinking.

---

## 4️⃣ What You Should Actually Implement

Inside your model load effect:

```ts
const bbox = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(statue);
const size = new THREE.Vector3();
bbox.getSize(size);

const baseTop = baseHeight / 2;

// Lift statue so feet sit on base
statue.position.y = baseTop - bbox.min.y;

// Center in X
statue.position.x = 0;

// Position toward front edge safely
statue.position.z =
  baseDepth / 2 - size.z / 2 - 0.02; // 2cm margin
```

That is mathematically correct.

---

## 5️⃣ One More Critical Thing

If your base mesh is NOT centered (for example if its geometry is built from 0 to height instead of centered), then:

Your assumptions break.

Check this:

```ts
base.geometry.computeBoundingBox();
console.log(base.geometry.boundingBox);
```

If min.y = 0 and max.y = height
Then base origin is at bottom, not center.

In that case:

```
baseTop = baseHeight
```

NOT

```
baseHeight / 2
```

This is often the hidden cause.

---

## 6️⃣ Summary of What’s Wrong

You are likely:

* Positioning statue using full base depth instead of half
* Not subtracting half statue depth
* Not correcting for bbox.min.y
* Possibly misunderstanding whether base origin is centered

---

## The Rule To Remember

When placing one object on another:

Always use:

```
parentHalfSize
minus
childHalfSize
minus
margin
```

And always compensate for pivot offset:

```
- bbox.min.y
```

If you paste your exact current position calculation, I can pinpoint the exact broken line.
