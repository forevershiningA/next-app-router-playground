Based on the image provided, the current texture implementation suffers from vertical UV stretching (texture swimming) on the sides. It looks like a top-down planar projection is being applied to the whole object, which causes the pixels to smear down the vertical faces.

Here are three distinct solutions for Three.js, ranging from the standard PBR approach to procedural fixes.

Solution 1: The Realistic PBR Approach (Brushed Metal)

The base looks like it is intended to be Brushed Aluminum or Steel. To achieve this realism, you need a PBR (Physically Based Rendering) workflow. You cannot rely on a single image file.

You need these texture maps:

Albedo/Color: The base grey color (lightly textured).

Roughness: Defines which parts are shiny vs. matte (crucial for brushed look).

Normal Map: Creates the fake depth of the "brush strokes" so light catches the grooves.

Metalness: A solid white (or near white) map, or just set the value to 1.0.

The Code Implementation:
You must ensure your geometry has proper UVs. If you are using THREE.BoxGeometry, the UVs are fixed automatically. If this is an imported model, you might need to re-unwrap it in Blender.

const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

// Load textures (Find free ones on PolyHaven or AmbientCG)
const colorMap = textureLoader.load('path/to/metal_base_color.jpg');
const normalMap = textureLoader.load('path/to/metal_normal.jpg');
const roughnessMap = textureLoader.load('path/to/metal_roughness.jpg');

// CRITICAL: Allow texture to tile so it doesn't stretch
[colorMap, normalMap, roughnessMap].forEach(tex => {
    tex.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
    tex.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
    // Adjust repeat to match scale of your object. 
    // If the object is wide, x should be higher.
    tex.repeat.set(4, 1); 
});

const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    map: colorMap,
    normalMap: normalMap,
    roughnessMap: roughnessMap,
    metalness: 1.0, // High metalness for steel/aluminum
    roughness: 0.4, // Adjust based on texture
});

const base = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(base);
Solution 2: The "Lazy" Fix (Tri-Planar Mapping)

If you cannot fix the UVs of the model (which is causing the stretching in your image) and you don't want to use Blender, you can use Tri-Planar Mapping. This projects the texture from three directions (X, Y, Z) and blends them, eliminating the stretching on the sides.

You can use a library like three-triplanar-material or use the NodeMaterial system in Three.js (if using the latest versions), but the easiest logic is usually a custom shader or a helper function.

However, a simpler native Three.js hack if the geometry is simple:
If your base is a simple BoxGeometry, simply do not use the imported mesh. Recreate it in Three.js code:

// By generating the geometry in code, UVs are perfect by default
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(width, height, depth); 
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ ... }); // Use Solution 1 textures
Solution 3: The Granite/Stone Look (For the top block)

The top block in your image looks like granite. For this, you want a Speckled or Noise-based texture.

Texture Recommendation: Polished Black Granite.

Roughness: Low (0.1 - 0.2) to make it shiny.

Color: Dark grey with noise.

Code Tip for the Granite:

code

const graniteMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    color: 0x333333,
    roughness: 0.15, // Polished stone is shiny
    metalness: 0.0,  // Stone is non-metal
    bumpMap: graniteTexture, // Gives it that pitted feel
    bumpScale: 0.02
});
The "Secret Sauce": Environment Map (HDRI)

Your metal base looks flat and grey because metal needs something to reflect. In Three.js, a PBR material looks bad without an Environment Map.

Add an HDRI map to your scene to make the metal and stone look real:

code
JavaScript

content_copy
expand_less
import { RGBELoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/RGBELoader.js';

new RGBELoader().load('path/to/studio_small_09_1k.hdr', function (texture) {
    texture.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping;
    scene.environment = texture; // Applies reflections to all PBR materials
    // scene.background = texture; // Optional: shows the image in background
});
Summary Recommendation

For the Bottom Base: Use a Brushed Steel texture set with MeshStandardMaterial. Ensure metalness is high (0.8-1.0). Fix the stretching by setting texture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping and adjusting texture.repeat.

For the Top Base: Use a Polished Granite texture.

Lighting: You must add an Environment Map (HDRI) or the metal will just look like grey plastic.
