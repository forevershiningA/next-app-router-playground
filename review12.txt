Right, so the problem is still that the SEHOVIC design was *authored* on an iPhone with DPR≈3, so all its saved X/Y positions **and** sizes (font sizes + motif heights) are effectively 3× larger than a “normal” desktop design.

In your last version we:

* Still divided X/Y by DPR sometimes,
* **But we were no longer dividing font size and motif height by DPR.**

So positions were closer, but the text and motifs were still huge / mis-aligned.

I’ve now updated **your actual `DesignPageClient.tsx` file** with a targeted fix:

### What I changed (already applied to the file you uploaded)

1. **Inscriptions – normalize everything by DPR when `designDpr > 1`**

In the inscriptions layer:

```ts
const savedDpr = scalingFactors.designDpr || 1;
const normalizeByDpr = savedDpr > 1;
```

Then for font size:

```ts
// Normalize font size by DPR if needed (for high-DPR authoring, e.g. iPhone)
const canvasFontSize = normalizeByDpr
  ? fontSizeInPx / savedDpr
  : fontSizeInPx;

const fontSize = canvasFontSize * (scalingFactors.uniformScale || 1);
```

X/Y are still mapped like this:

```ts
const canvasX = normalizeByDpr ? rawX / savedDpr : rawX;
const canvasY = normalizeByDpr ? rawY / savedDpr : rawY;

const dispX =
  (scalingFactors.offsetX || 0) + (canvasX + initW / 2) * uniformScale;
const dispY =
  (scalingFactors.offsetY || 0) + (canvasY + initH / 2) * uniformScale;
```

So on an iPhone-authored design (DPR 3):

* X, Y, and font size are all divided by 3 in “canvas space”
* Then scaled by the same `uniformScale` that the headstone uses

On desktop designs (no DPR saved, or DPR=1), no normalization happens.

2. **Motifs – normalize positions and height by DPR when `designDpr > 1`**

In the motifs layer:

```ts
const savedDpr = scalingFactors.designDpr || 1;
const normalizeByDpr = savedDpr > 1;
```

Coordinates:

```ts
const canvasX = normalizeByDpr ? rawX / savedDpr : rawX;
const canvasY = normalizeByDpr ? rawY / savedDpr : rawY;
```

Motif height:

```ts
let motifHeightCanvas: number | undefined;
if (typeof motif.height === 'number') {
  // Normalize motif height by DPR if needed (for high-DPR authoring)
  motifHeightCanvas = normalizeByDpr
    ? motif.height / savedDpr
    : motif.height;
}
```

And then we scale to display as before:

```ts
let motifHeight = motifHeightCanvas
  ? motifHeightCanvas * uniformScale
  : (svgDims ? svgDims.height * ratio * uniformScale : 100 * uniformScale);

let motifWidth = motifHeightCanvas
  ? motifHeightCanvas * aspect * uniformScale
  : (svgDims ? svgDims.width * ratio * uniformScale : 100 * uniformScale);
```

### What this should do for SEHOVIC / PINTO

* Designs saved on iPhone (DPR 3) now have **X, Y, font sizes and motif sizes all divided by 3** before scaling – so they should line up with the stone and be the correct visual size.
* Desktop-authored designs, and any older designs without a DPR value, are unaffected (`savedDpr` defaults to 1).
* Because inscriptions/motifs now use the same `uniformScale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`, `initW`, and `initH` that the headstone uses, everything should stay glued together across desktop and mobile.
