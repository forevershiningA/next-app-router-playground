You’re seeing it because **Serpentine is hard-coded to render narrower than the canvas**.

In `DesignPageClient.tsx` there’s a Serpentine-only block that builds the `<path>` manually and sets:

* `const w = scalingFactors.displayWidth * 0.8;`
* `const offsetX = scalingFactors.displayWidth * 0.1;`

That forces the tablet to 80% width and centers it, so it always looks smaller than other shapes that render full-bleed. 

There’s also another copy of the Serpentine block in the same file that already uses full width:

* `const w = scalingFactors.displayWidth;`
* `const offsetX = 0;`

…but if the first (80%/0.1) version is the one hit at runtime, you’ll still get the shrunken tablet. 

### What to change

In the Serpentine branch, make it match the full-bleed logic used by other shapes:

```ts
// Serpentine path builder
const w = scalingFactors.displayWidth;   // not *0.8
const h = scalingFactors.displayHeight;
const offsetX = 0;                       // not *0.1
```

Also search the file for duplicate `shapeName === 'Serpentine' && shapeData` blocks and **keep only the full-width version** to avoid the narrow one being chosen by mistake. 

Nothing else (base sizing, inscriptions mapping, etc.) is shrinking this design—the top/bottom/base calculations key off the full fitted canvas and are shape-agnostic. 

After this tweak, the page should match the screenshot you referenced.
