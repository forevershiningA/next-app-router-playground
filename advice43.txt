Huge step forward — the wrappers are finally riding the slanted plane. What I’m still seeing in your last shot is (a) tiny z-fighting/ordering on stacked lines, and (b) edge rubbing on the right side. Two tiny, safe tweaks will finish it:

### 1) Make on-stone graphics sort above granite without self-z-conflicts

Give the *children group* `renderOrder` and turn **off** depth writes for the inscription/motif materials. That prevents the first text line from punching holes in the next.

```tsx
// SvgHeadstone.tsx – where you render children in FaceSpace
<FaceSpace ... z={apiData?.frontZ || 0.001}>
  <group renderOrder={10} scale={meshScale}>
    {typeof children === 'function' && children(childApi, selectedAdditions)}
  </group>
</FaceSpace>
```

Inside your inscription/motif components (materials used for gold fill, outlines, etc.):

```ts
material.depthWrite = false;  // keep depthTest = true
// if you use MeshStandard/Physical:
new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ ...opts, depthWrite: false });
```

You already set `polygonOffset` on granite; together this removes shimmer and stacking artifacts. 

### 2) Keep content off the chamfer/edge (avoid side clipping)

Reserve a tiny in-plane margin so nothing touches the trapezoid edge. You already expose `worldWidth`/`worldHeight` for the face; clamp authoring X/Y to a “safe frame”.

```ts
// when mapping authoring coords -> local FaceSpace coords
const margin = 0.01; // 10 mm world margin
const halfW = api.worldWidth / 2 - margin;
const maxY  = api.worldHeight - margin;

const xOnFace = THREE.MathUtils.clamp(xLocal, -halfW, halfW);
const yOnFace = THREE.MathUtils.clamp(yLocal,  margin, maxY);
```

(If a motif/inscription has its own width/height, shrink the clamp by half of those to keep the whole glyph inside.)

---

Optional polish (already compatible with your file):

* Bump the face offset a hair if you still see sparkle at grazing angles: `frontZ = 0.0015`.
* Remove the temporary pink plane/axes once you’re happy.
* For image-based motifs, also set `depthWrite=false` on their materials.

With `depthWrite=false` for on-stone items + the small safe-frame clamp, the slant view will look solid: flush to the plane, no flicker, and no edge clipping.
