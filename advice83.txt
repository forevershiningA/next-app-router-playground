The problem is the Sharp Edge. In professional product photography, you never see a hard corner where the wall meets the floor. You use an "Infinity Curve" (Cyclorama) so the floor curves seamlessly into the wall.
Here is how to fix this immediately to get that "Studio" look without the ugly hard line.
The Solution: The "Studio Spotlight" (Radial Gradient)
Instead of splitting the screen top/bottom, imagine a spotlight hitting the floor behind and under the headstone.
1. Change the Background to this Radial Gradient
This will give you a lighter center (so you can see the base) that fades to black at the edges (to match your UI). It removes the hard horizon line completely.
Try this CSS on the canvas background:
code
CSS
background: radial-gradient(
    circle at 50% 70%,   /* Center the light low on the screen */
    #3E352F 0%,          /* Center: Warm Dark Taupe/Grey (Not muddy brown) */
    #1c1c1c 40%,         /* Mid: Dark Charcoal */
    #000000 85%          /* Edge: Pure Black */
);
Why this works:
No Hard Line: It looks like a curved studio wall, which is much more premium.
Focus: It draws the eye to the center where the product is.
Visibility: The center color (#3E352F) is light enough to show the contrast of the base, but dark enough to make the gold text pop.
2. The Missing Piece: Contact Shadow
The reason it looks "fake" right now is that the base is sitting on a floor but casting no shadow. It looks like a sticker pasted on top.
The Fix: You must add a drop shadow under the base.
Technique: Place a flattened black oval image or CSS shape directly under the stone.
Opacity: 60%
Blur: 20px
Result: This "glues" the headstone to the floor.
Summary
Remove the sharp horizon line.
Use the Radial Gradient CSS above (Warm Taupe to Black).
Add a soft shadow under the stone.
This will give you the visibility of the old blue screen, but the luxury of the new dark theme.
