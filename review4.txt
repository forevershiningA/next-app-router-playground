Based on a visual comparison between the reference design (left) and the 3D layout (right), here are the changes needed to make the right side match the left:

1. Top Decoration (Leaves & Birds)

Current (Right): There are four separate, small elements (two disconnected birds on the edges and two small leaf clusters in the center).

Required Change: Replace these with the single, continuous vine/leaf garland design seen on the left. The birds should be perched on the ends of the vine rather than floating separately.

2. Central Figure (Statue)

Current (Right): The figure depicts a standing person in robes (possibly Jesus or a generic saint) with their head bowed.

Required Change: Change the artwork to the "Madonna and Child" (Mary holding the baby Jesus) as seen on the left.

3. Right-Side Name

Current (Right): The top name reads "TERESA ISABELLA".

Required Change: Change the name to "BYRON WEBB" to match the left image.

4. Bottom Left Graphic

Current (Right): The graphic is a small, indistinct dark cluster (possibly a rose or rock).

Required Change: Replace this with the Water Lily / Lotus Flower artwork seen on the left.

5. Bottom Right Graphic

Current (Right): There is a small cross and a separate circular seal/emblem.

Required Change: Replace these with the specific cross and emblem combination seen on the left. The cross on the left is simpler, and the emblem next to it appears to be praying hands or a specific religious icon rather than the seal shown on the right.
