This is a huge improvement in usability and clarity. The changes to the text ("Inscriptions & Art," "Review & Save") and the CTA ("Start Customizing This Design") make the user flow much more logical.

However, visually, the center of the screen is still a "black hole." Because the background is dark and the product is a dark silhouette, there is zero depth.

Here are the final 4 steps to make this look like a premium tool:

1. Turn on the Lights (Crucial)

The headstone currently looks like a flat 2D vector shape. It needs to look like a 3D object.

The Fix: Your 3D render needs lighting.

Add a "specular highlight" (a reflection of light) along the top curved edge of the heart.

Add a subtle gradient to the face of the stone. Real polished black granite reflects the sky/environment; it is never 100% solid matte black.

Why: Without reflections, the user can't tell if it's stone, plastic, or paper.

2. Make the Text Look "Engraved"

The text "In our hearts you live forever" looks like yellow text floating on top of the image.

The Fix: Apply an "Inner Shadow" or "Bevel" effect to the text in the image.

The Detail: In real life, gold lettering on headstones is carved into the stone. It has depth. If you simulate that depth (even slightly), the quality of the preview skyrockets.

3. Remove Redundant Labels

You currently have labels identifying the product in two places around the image:

Top Left: "Studio Preview... Heart Shape... Glory Black Granite"

Bottom Overlay: "Style: Heart... Material: Glory Black"

The Fix: Delete the top row entirely.

Remove the "Studio Preview" label and the pill buttons at the top left.

Keep the clean, dark labels at the bottom ("Style: Heart | Material: Glory Black"). They look much more modern and integrated.

Result: This clears up the header space and puts all the focus on the product.

4. Adjust the "Step" Visuals

On the right menu, Step 01 has a gold icon, but Steps 02, 03, and 04 have dark grey icons.

The Issue: The grey icons look disabled (unclickable).

The Fix: Even if Step 01 is "Active," make the icons for 02-04 a lighter grey or a thin gold outline. You want the user to know they can click ahead to see materials if they want to.

Summary Checklist

Render: Add light reflections to the heart shape so it looks 3D.

Text: Add inner shadow to the quote so it looks engraved.

Cleanup: Delete the top-left labels (redundant).

Menu: Brighten the inactive icons (Steps 2-4) so they don't look broken.

Once you add that lighting to the stone, this section is done. It's functionally perfect now; it just needs that visual "pop."
