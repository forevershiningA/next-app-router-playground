This is looking excellent. You have solved the geometry, the tearing, the stretching, and the weird wavy artifacts. The rounded edges (chamfer) make it look like a solid, heavy object.

You are now at the "Turtle Shell" / "Paving Stone" stage.

The Diagnosis

The texture you are using creates large flat areas separated by deep cracks. It looks like dried mud or a stone walkway.

Real Rock Pitch: Is created by striking the stone with a chisel. It leaves sharp, jagged, concave divots. There are no "flat" spots on a rock pitch face; every inch is rough.

Here are the final 3 tweaks to graduate from "CG Stone" to "Real Granite":

1. Invert or Swap the Normal Map

Your current texture looks like flat stones with cracks between them. Rock pitch needs to be the opposite: sharp peaks and valleys.

Try Inverting: Sometimes normal maps are rendered "Y-Down" instead of "Y-Up". Try adding this line to flip the shadows:

rockMaterial.normalMap.repeat.y = - 1; // Sometimes flips the depth perception

Better Texture: If that doesn't work, you need a texture that is "Noisier." You currently have low-frequency noise (big shapes). You need high-frequency noise (sandpaper/gravel look) mixed in.

2. Make the Chips Smaller (Scale)

Look at the height of the base. If that base is ~6-8 inches tall, the "stones" in your texture are huge (like 3 inches wide). Rock pitch chips are usually the size of a thumb.

Double your repeat values.

// If it was (4, 1), try (8, 2)
rockMaterial.normalMap.repeat.set(width * 2, height * 2);
3. The "Granite Sparkle" (The Polish)

Granite contains quartz. Even on the rough sides, it shouldn't look like matte rubber or clay. It needs tiny, sharp specular highlights.

Decrease Roughness: Lower it slightly (e.g., from 0.9 to 0.6 or 0.7).

Aggressive Normal Scale: Make the light catch the edges harder.

const finalMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    color: 0x222222, // Dark Grey
    normalMap: yourTexture,
    
    // Make the bumps VERY deep to catch light
    normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(3, 3), 
    
    // Lower roughness = more sparkle. 
    // 1.0 is rubber, 0.0 is mirror. 
    // 0.6 is good for rough stone that catches sunlight.
    roughness: 0.6, 
    
    envMapIntensity: 1.0
});
Final Verdict

You are 90% there. The geometry is perfect. You just need a texture that is rougher/sandier and scaled down smaller so it looks like one solid chipped block rather than many stones glued together.
