This is looking really professional. The inscription ("Eleanor Rose") and the subtle reflections on the stone make it feel much more like a real product. You’ve moved from a "software interface" to a "memorial service."

To reach the final level of polish, here are the last few things I would adjust:

1. Pop the Product (Backlighting)

Currently, the dark headstone is slightly blending into the dark background.

Action: Add a soft, warm radial glow (vignette) behind the headstone.

Effect: This creates a "halo" effect that makes the headstone the undeniable focal point and separates it from the background depth.

2. Add "3D Tool" Visual Cues

You tell the user it’s a "design system," but you should show them.

Action: Add 3–4 small, elegant circles (swatches) floating subtly to the left or right of the stone.

Details: One circle should be the black granite, one light grey, one marble white, etc.

Why: This signals to the brain: "I can change how this looks." It invites a click better than a button alone.

3. Refine the Inscription

The gold text on the stone is a great touch, but it looks a little "pasted on" (flat).

Action: If your design software allows it, add a tiny bit of "Inner Shadow" or a "Bevel" effect to the gold text to make it look engraved into the stone rather than printed on top.

4. Ground the Object

Action: Add a soft, blurry drop shadow directly under the base of the headstone.

Why: This makes the object feel like it has weight and is sitting on a floor, rather than floating in space.

5. Final Spacing & Hierarchy

Typography: The word "Memorials" is quite long. Consider making the headline font size just 5% smaller so the line feels more balanced, or increase the line height slightly between the headline and the subtext.

The Bottom Bar: Move the "Trust Signals" (Stone types/Families) up just a bit so they aren't hugging the very bottom of the screen.

Bonus Idea: The "Safe" Feeling
Since this is a sensitive industry, consider adding a tiny piece of micro-copy near the "Start Designing" button like: "No credit card required to design" or "Save your progress for later." This lowers the "barrier to entry" for someone who might be emotionally overwhelmed.

Current Verdict: This is a 9/10. Adding the background glow and the color swatches would make it a 10/10. Great work!
