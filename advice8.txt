This is an excellent iteration. You have solved the major structural problems. The layout is logical, the copy is empathetic ("Comfort of Home"), and the flow is clear.

However, visually, it still feels a little "muddy" and "tech-heavy." To turn this into a high-end, trustworthy landing page, you need to refine the Image and the Contrast.

Here are the final 4 steps to polish this design:

1. The Image is Breaking the Immersion (Critical)

The image currently looks like a screenshot of software rather than a photo of a memory. The user wants to see the beautiful result, not the tool's interface.

What to Remove (The "Tech" Artifacts):

The Left Sidebar: On the far left of the image, there is a dark vertical strip with buttons like "Base" and "Stand." Crop this out.

The Floating Label: The text box floating in the sky ("Traditional Engraved Headstone") looks like a tooltip. Hide or Photoshop it out.

The Selection Brackets: There are faint white corners around the text on the stone. This implies the text is "selected" in an editor. The render should show the stone unselected.

The Price Tag: The tiny green number at the bottom center makes it feel transactional too soon.

The Goal: The image should look like a clean, cinematic photo of a headstone standing in a peaceful grassy field.

2. Brighten the "Muddy" Colors

Your background is black, and your accent colors are dark brown/gold. This makes the page feel low-energy and hard to read.

The CTA Button: The "Start Designing" button is a dark, brownish mustard color. It recedes into the background.

Fix: Brighten this significantly to a vibrant metallic gold or amber. It should be the brightest thing on the page to draw the eye.

The Icons: The icons in the middle row (Eye, Document, Bookmark) are dark gold on dark grey. They are almost invisible.

Fix: Make these icons the same bright gold as your new button.

3. Fix the "Wall of Boxes"

You currently have three rows of boxes stacked on top of each other:

The Phase Cards (Top)

The Features Row (Middle)

The Stats Row (Bottom)

This creates a repetitive "grid" look.

The Fix: Remove the box backgrounds from the Middle Row (Features).

Instead of putting "See every change..." inside a dark box, just let the icon and text float on the black background.

Why? This creates visual "breathing room" between the Phase cards and the Stats. It breaks up the grid.

4. Align the Phase Cards

The Issue: The "Phase 3" card is shorter than Phase 1 and 2 because it has less text. This creates a jagged bottom line.

The Fix: Set a min-height on these cards so all three are exactly the same height. This makes the design look professional and stable.

Final "Before & After" Checklist
Element	Current State	Target State
Main Image	Screenshot with UI buttons & lines	Clean, cinematic "photo" (cropped & retouched)
CTA Button	Dark Brown/Mustard	Bright, Vibrant Gold
Middle Row	Dark Grey Boxes	Clean Text & Icons (No background)
Phase Cards	Uneven heights	Equal Height

You are very close! Cleaning up that image to look like a photograph is the most important step remaining.
