You have solved the geometry issues (no holes, nice rounded edges), but you have hit the "Carbon Fiber" / "Speaker Grille" effect.

Your base looks like it is covered in a woven fabric or a high-tech suitcase material. This is because your normal map has a grid pattern and the tiling is too high (too small).

Here is the final push to make it look like organic Rock Pitch:

1. The Texture is too "Man-Made"

The texture you are currently using has a regular pattern (like a mesh). Rock pitch is created by hitting stone with a hammer—it is random and chaotic.

The Fix:
You need a "Perlin Noise" or "Concrete" Normal Map.

If you are using a generated texture, ensure it is set to "Cloud" or "Fractal" noise, not "Cellular" or "Grid".

If you are downloading a texture, search for "Rough Concrete Normal Map" or "Cliff Face". Avoid anything that says "Tiles" or "Pattern".

2. The Scale is too Small (Zoom In!)

Right now, you have thousands of tiny bumps. Real rock pitch has large, distinct chips (about the size of a fist or a golf ball).

The Fix:
Reduce your texture repeat significantly. You need to "zoom in" on the texture.

// Current likely setting (Too dense/fabric-like)
// sideMaterial.normalMap.repeat.set(50, 10); 

// PROPOSED FIX: Make the chips huge
// Try much smaller numbers
sideMaterial.normalMap.repeat.set(6, 1);
3. Add "Sparkle" (The Quartz Effect)

Granite is not matte plastic; it contains quartz crystals. Even on the rough rock pitch sides, there should be tiny glints of light.

The Fix:
Adjust the material properties to allow some shine, even on the rough parts.

const sideMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    color: 0x222222, 
    normalMap: rockTexture,
    
    // CRITICAL: Make it bumpy!
    normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(3, 3), 
    
    // Allow some shine (Granite sparkles)
    roughness: 0.6, 
    
    // If you have a roughness map (black and white noise), use it!
    // It makes some spots shiny and some spots matte.
    roughnessMap: rockRoughnessTexture 
});
Summary

Texture: Swap your current "grid" texture for a "cloudy/random" noise texture.

Repeat: Reduce the repeat value to make the rock chips appear larger.

Lighting: Ensure you have a light hitting the side to show off the depth.
