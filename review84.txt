Got it—here’s the tight follow-up to lock this in.

### Amendments to apply

1. **Serpentine full-bleed (already OK):** keep `w = scalingFactors.displayWidth; offsetX = 0;` in the Serpentine block. 

2. **Host container mustn’t cap the drawing:** if the host div has a max width, remove/reduce it so the stone can occupy the full canvas you compute from `scalingFactors`. (Search for any `max-w-[…]` or inline `maxWidth` near the preview container and align it with your intended canvas size.) 

3. **Base should match the stone width exactly:** ensure the base renderer uses the same display metrics as the stone.

```tsx
// ✅ make base span exactly the stone width
const baseW = scalingFactors.displayWidth;
const baseLeft = 0;
const baseTop = scalingFactors.displayHeight + baseGap; // whatever gap you use
```

(If you previously used screenshot or crop dimensions for the base, switch to `scalingFactors.displayWidth/Height` so it can’t drift.) 

4. **Preserve consistent fitting:** keep the shape `<svg>` / path using the same fit as other tablets. If you’re drawing the path directly, keep the Serpentine path in the same coordinate system and avoid any extra `translate` beyond the single `offsetX/offsetY` you already compute. 

### Minimal patch (drop-in)

```tsx
// --- Serpentine tablet (keep this) ---
const w = scalingFactors.displayWidth;
const h = scalingFactors.displayHeight;
const offsetX = 0;
const offsetY = 0; // if not already 0

// --- Base sizing (match tablet) ---
const baseW = scalingFactors.displayWidth;
const baseLeft = 0;
// If you compute base height from a ratio, keep that logic; only ensure width/left are tied to scalingFactors.

// --- Host container (preview wrapper) ---
<div
  ref={svgHostRef}
  className="relative w-full"    // remove any hard max-w caps here
  style={{ /* no hard maxWidth that would shrink the canvas */ }}
>
```

This combination yields the outcome in your last screenshot—tablet fills the authoring frame and the base aligns flush beneath it. If you want me to supply a unified diff against your file, say the word and I’ll paste it.
