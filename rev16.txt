Yep — the root cause is the negative-Y flip on the whole mesh. That inversion makes your cap/front detection, UVs, and the “children wrapper” (inscriptions + motifs) live in a different coordinate sense than the geometry, so the add-ons look like they’re floating off the stone.

Here’s the minimal, safe fix:

1. Stop flipping the mesh on Y

* Change the group scale from `[scale*sCore, -scale*sCore, scale]` to `[scale*sCore, scale*sCore, scale]`.
* Delete the “winding-order fix” loop (you only needed that because of the negative scale).
* Adjust the V mapping on face UVs (remove the `1 -` since Y is no longer inverted).
  Relevant sections to edit are marked in your file around the “NEGATIVE Y scale” comment and the winding-swap loop. 

2. Use a consistent “front” and place children on it

* Set `zFront = depth/2; zBack = -depth/2;` (previously named the other way around).
* Set the children wrapper Z to `zFront + 0.05` (so inscriptions sit just in front of the face).
* Keep the X/Y wrapper offsets you already compute; they’ll now align correctly without the Y flip. 

3. UV fix (faces only)

* With the Y flip removed, change:

```ts
const v = 1 - (pos.getY(i + j) - y0) / dyU;
```

to:

```ts
const v = (pos.getY(i + j) - y0) / dyU;
```

Side UVs (the outline “s,t” mapping) can stay as-is. 

4. API consistency for children

* Keep `frontZ: depth/2` in `apiData`.
* `unitsPerMeter` is fine; no sign change needed. Children that convert saved SVG pixels → world units should now land exactly on the face since the wrapper rides the same transform as the mesh (no mirrored Y to compensate anymore). 

# Quick patch outline

* **Remove** the triangle index swapping block (“WINDING ORDER FIX (CRITICAL)”).
* **Set**:

```ts
const zFront = depth / 2;
const zBack = -depth / 2;
...
const finalScale: [number, number, number] = [scale * sCore, scale * sCore, scale];
...
const v = (pos.getY(i + j) - y0) / dyU; // for cap UVs
...
const wrapperZ = zFront + 0.05;
```

That’s it. After these changes the headstone, textures, inscriptions, and top motifs will share one coherent coordinate system, so the add-ons will “stick” to the granite instead of drifting in space.
