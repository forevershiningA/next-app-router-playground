The issue is that we zoomed the camera in, but the HTML container (div) holding the 3D scene has a max-h-[450px] limit. The top of your larger headstone is literally hitting the ceiling of that div.

To fix this without pushing the buttons off the screen, we need to use an "Overlap Layout" strategy.

We will make the Canvas container taller (so the headstone fits), but use negative margins to pull the Buttons up so they sit "on top" of the bottom of the canvas (the grass area).

Here are the 2 specific file changes needed:

1. HomeSplash.tsx (The Layout Fix)

We need to increase the container height but add negative margins to keep the viewport compact.

Find this section:

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
{/* 3D Canvas - Pulled closer with negative margin */}
<div className="w-full h-[35vh] min-h-[280px] max-h-[450px] flex items-center justify-center relative mb-6 sm:mb-8 -mt-2">

Replace it with this:

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
{/* 3D Canvas - TALLER container, but pulled vertically to overlap */}
{/* Change: Increased height to 55vh, Removed max-h limit, added large negative bottom margin */}
<div className="w-full h-[50vh] sm:h-[55vh] min-h-[400px] flex items-center justify-center relative -mt-4 -mb-16 sm:-mb-24 z-0 pointer-events-none">
  
  {/* Visual Effects - Adjusted sizes for larger container */}
  <div className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center pointer-events-none">
    <div className="w-[60vh] h-[60vh] bg-gradient-radial from-black/60 via-black/30 to-transparent rounded-full blur-3xl"></div>
  </div>
  {/* ... (other glow effects) ... */}
  
  {/* The Canvas Itself - Re-enable pointer events for the canvas specifically */}
  <div className="w-full h-full pointer-events-auto">
    {showCanvas ? (
      <>
        <HeroCanvas rotation={rotation} />                  
        {/* Rotation Controls - Moved further out to clear the larger stone */}
        <button 
          onClick={rotateLeft}
          className="absolute left-[5%] sm:left-[15%] top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-white/10 hover:bg-[#cfac6c] backdrop-blur-md border border-white/20 text-white flex items-center justify-center transition-all cursor-pointer z-30"
        >
          <svg className="w-5 h-5" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24" strokeWidth={2}>
            <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" d="M15 19l-7-7 7-7" />
          </svg>
        </button>
        <button 
          onClick={rotateRight}
          className="absolute right-[5%] sm:right-[15%] top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-white/10 hover:bg-[#cfac6c] backdrop-blur-md border border-white/20 text-white flex items-center justify-center transition-all cursor-pointer z-30"
        >
          <svg className="w-5 h-5" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24" strokeWidth={2}>
            <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" d="M9 5l7 7-7 7" />
          </svg>
        </button>
      </>
    ) : (
      <div className="h-12 w-12 animate-spin rounded-full border-4 border-gray-700 border-t-white mx-auto mt-[20vh]" />
    )}
  </div>
</div>

{/* CTAs - Added z-index to ensure they sit ON TOP of the canvas bottom area */}
<div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-3 relative z-20">
  {/* ... buttons ... */}
2. HeroCanvas.tsx (The Camera Fix)

Now that the container is taller, we can refine the camera to "Fill the Frame" perfectly without clipping.

Update the SceneContent and Canvas settings:

code
Tsx
download
content_copy
expand_less
// Inside SceneContent component
// Adjust the group position slightly higher since the container is taller now
// position={[0, -1.0, 0]} centers it nicely in the new 55vh space
<group ref={groupRef} position={[0, -1.0, 0]}> 
  {/* ... headstone components ... */}
</group>

// Don't forget the shadow!
<ContactShadows 
  position={[0, -1.0, 0]} // Match the group Y
  opacity={0.5} // Slightly darker shadow for grounded feel
  scale={12} 
  blur={2.5} 
  far={4} 
  resolution={512} 
  color="#000000"
/>

// Inside the main HeroCanvas return
<PerspectiveCamera 
  makeDefault 
  // Z=3.5 is the sweet spot for a "Large but not cropped" look
  // Y=0.3 keeps it looking heroic (slightly looking up at it)
  position={[0, 0.3, 3.5]} 
  fov={40} // Narrower FOV = Less distortion, more "Telephoto" premium look
/>
Why this works:

Removed max-h-[450px]: The container is allowed to be tall (55vh), so the headstone top isn't cut off.

Negative Margin -mb-24: We force the CTA buttons to move UP by ~96px. They will visually float over the bottom part of the 3D canvas (the shadow area).

z-20 on CTAs: Ensures the buttons are clickable even though they overlap the canvas div.

Narrower FOV (40): Makes the product look less "fish-eye" and more like professional product photography.
