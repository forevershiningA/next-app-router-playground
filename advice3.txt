This is a great example of the "Displacement Bleeding" problem.

You have successfully applied the rough texture, but now the physics of the stone are broken. In the real world, a granite base is sawn flat on the top and bottom, and pitched (chipped) only on the sides.

Currently, your displacement map is pushing the vertices at the edge of the top face, making the straight sawn line look like "melted wax" or torn paper.

Here are the 3 steps to fix this specific look in Three.js:

1. Fix the "Melted" Top Edge (Critical)

You cannot use the same material settings for the Top and the Sides. The Top needs to be perfectly flat (0 displacement), and the Sides need to be rough.

Since BoxGeometry shares vertices at the corners, when the side moves out, it pulls the top down.

The Solution: Use an Array of Materials.
You need to assign a separate material to the Top/Bottom faces that has displacementScale: 0.

// 1. The Rough Material (For the sides)
const roughMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    map: graniteTexture,
    displacementMap: heightTexture,
    displacementScale: 0.3, // The strength of the spikes
    roughness: 0.8
});

// 2. The Polished Material (For Top/Bottom)
// CRITICAL: No displacement map here!
const polishedMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    map: graniteTexture,
    displacementScale: 0, // Keeps the edge essentially a straight line
    roughness: 0.1
});

// 3. Apply to the mesh
// BoxGeometry material order: Right, Left, Top, Bottom, Front, Back
const materials = [
    roughMaterial,    // Right (Rough)
    roughMaterial,    // Left (Rough)
    polishedMaterial, // Top (FLAT & POLISHED)
    polishedMaterial, // Bottom (Flat)
    roughMaterial,    // Front (Rough)
    roughMaterial     // Back (Rough)
];

const base = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, materials);
2. Fix the "Stretched Taffy" Look (UV Mapping)

Look at the long side of your block. The waves look stretched horizontally. This happens because the texture is being stretched across a long surface.

The Solution: You need to repeat the texture so the "rock chips" stay the same size regardless of how long the block is.

// Set the texture to repeat
graniteTexture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
graniteTexture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;

// Adjust repeat based on the size of your block
// If width is 10 and height is 2, repeat X should be 5x higher than Y
graniteTexture.repeat.set(5, 1);
3. Improve the "Sharpness" (Normals)

Right now, the shadows on the bumps look very soft, like dough or clay. Granite chips are sharp crystals.

The Solution:

Flat Shading: If you want a "low poly" chiseled look, set flatShading: true in your material.

Normal Map: If you want a realistic look, you need to load a Normal Map (the purple texture) along with your displacement map. The Normal map creates the illusion of sharp lighting cracks that the Displacement map (geometry) cannot create on its own.

Summary Checklist to render next:

Separate Top Material: Ensure the top face has Zero displacement.

Straight Edge: The line between the top gray face and the side black face must be straight (or very slightly jagged), not wavy.

Texture Repeat: Fix the stretching on the long side.
