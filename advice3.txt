This section is currently designed like a SaaS (Software as a Service) dashboard or a car configurator. While it looks sleek, it feels a bit cold and "transactional" for the funeral industry. When people are grieving, they are often overwhelmed, tired, and emotional.

Here is advice on how to transform this section to be more empathetic, reassuring, and user-friendly for funeral products.

1. The "8 Steps" Problem (Simplify the Cognitive Load)

Currently, seeing a list of 8 steps (Step 01 to Step 08) is intimidating. A grieving user might look at that list and think, "This is too much work, I don't have the energy for this."

The Fix: Group these steps into 3 simple phases. This makes the process feel manageable.

Phase 1: The Foundation (Combines Product, Shape, Material, Size)

Phase 2: The Tribute (Combines Inscriptions, Motifs, Additions)

Phase 3: Review (Check Price & Finalize)

Visual Change: Instead of a long vertical list on the right, use a horizontal 3-step process bar. It looks faster and easier.

2. Humanize the Language (Copywriting)

The current labels are robotic database terms. Change them to warm, human language that focuses on the loved one, not the software.

3. Soften the Visual Design

The high-contrast Black and Gold looks premium, but it also looks like a luxury nightclub or a crypto website. It lacks "softness."

Color Palette: Consider using a deep navy, forest green, or a softer charcoal grey instead of pitch black. This retains elegance but feels more organic.

Typography: The "Setup - Step 01" font looks like military stenciling. Remove the "Setup - Step XX" micro-copy entirely. It adds visual noise without adding value.

Icons: The square icons are very "techy." Use softer, more illustrative icons (e.g., a hand holding a pen for inscriptions, a stone texture for material).

4. Focus on "Safety" and "Collaboration"

In the funeral industry, people are terrified of making a mistake. They rarely decide alone; they need to show the family.

Highlight "Save & Share" more: The button currently says "Save & Share," but you should emphasize why.

New Copy Idea: "Design at your own pace. Save your draft and share it with family for feedback before you decide."

Reassurance on the "Instant Price":

Change "Instant Price" to "Transparent Pricing." This builds trust that there are no hidden fees, rather than just emphasizing speed.

5. Replace the "Dashboard" Screenshot

The image on the left shows the user interface with buttons and sliders. This highlights the work the user has to do.

The Fix: Show the result, not the tool. Show a beautiful, rotating 3D headstone in a peaceful setting (like the grass background you have, but without the UI overlay).

Overlay Text: Instead of showing the UI buttons in the image, put a simple caption: "See your changes instantly in realistic 3D."

Summary of Changes (Before vs. After)
Feature	Current (Tech-Focused)	Proposed (Empathy-Focused)
Structure	Vertical list of 8 granular steps	Horizontal flow of 3 simple phases
Copy	"Select Shape," "Select Motifs"	"Shape the Stone," "Personalize the Tribute"
Vibe	"Configure your product"	"Honor their memory"
Trust	"Instant Price"	"Transparent Pricing - No Hidden Fees"
Visuals	Dark, sharp, digital interface	Softer, organic, focus on the final stone

Why this works: By grouping the steps and softening the language, you move the user from a mindset of "I have to fill out a form" to "I am creating a meaningful tribute."
