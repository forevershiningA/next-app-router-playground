Good news: your slant math + wrapper rotation are fine. The thing that’s still off is the **wrapper’s Z position** for the slant. You’re placing the children wrapper at:

```ts
childWrapperPos: [0, 0, (depth / 2) * scale * sCore]
```

…but the **headstone mesh** is scaled as:

```ts
meshScale = [scale * sCore, scale * sCore, scale]
```

So the *front face Z* of the mesh is at **(+depth/2) × scale** (note: no `sCore` on Z).
Because the wrapper is using `× scale × sCore`, it sits **too far forward** by a factor of `sCore`. That breaks “flush-to-face” placement and makes all on-stone items look wrong (and sometimes disappear at grazing angles/depth test).

### Fix (slant branch only)

Change the wrapper position to use the same Z scale as the mesh:

```ts
// BEFORE
childWrapperPos: [0, 0, (depth / 2) * scale * sCore] as [number, number, number],

// AFTER
childWrapperPos: [0, 0, (depth / 2) * scale] as [number, number, number],
```

Leave `apiData.frontZ = 0.001` as is (that tiny local +Z offset keeps inscriptions/motifs just off the granite to avoid z-fighting). Keep your quaternion alignment and FaceSpace wrapper—those parts look correct.

If you want a quick proof, keep your hot-pink debug plane inside the FaceSpace. After this change it will sit perfectly on the slanted face, and your inscriptions/motifs/additions will finally look properly tilted and attached.
