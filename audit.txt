Absolutely—here’s a focused, programmatic-SEO audit for that page and the broader template powering it. I couldn’t fetch the exact page contents (likely client-side rendering/protection), but the URL and your stack give us enough signal to tighten your template so thousands of pages can rank cleanly.

# Quick read: what to fix first (programmatic impact)

**Critical (do these now)**

1. **URL format & canonicalization**

   * Current:
     `/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial/1704011685894_amazing-grace-for-god-so-loved-the-world-that-he-gave-his-on`
   * Problems: opaque numeric prefix, over-long slug, phrase truncated mid-word, potential for duplicate permutations.
   * **Fix**:

     * Canonical, human slug only:
       `/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial/amazing-grace-john-3-16`
     * Add a **stable canonical** on every item page pointing to the human slug (strip any ids/utm/query).
     * Implement **301** from any id-based or truncated variant → canonical.

2. **Deterministic on-page metadata (from fields)**

   * Add a template that fills **title / H1 / meta description / OG** from product fields (motif, verse, product type, material, size).
   * Sample mapping (pseudocode):

     * `title = "{Primary Verse or Motif}: {Product Type} | Forever Shining"`
     * `h1 = "{Motif} – {Primary Verse} {Reference}"`
     * `meta_description = "Design a {material} {product_type} featuring “{primary_verse}”. Sizes {min_size}–{max_size}. Preview online, get price instantly, free design help."`
     * `og:title = title`, `og:description = meta_description`, `og:image = hero_url`, `og:url = canonical_url`

3. **Item-level schema (JSON-LD)**

   * Use **`Product`** (or `CreativeWork` + `Product` if you prefer) with `brand`, `offers` (price range or “From $X”), `material`, `size`, `isAccessoryOrSparePartFor` (if it’s a motif/addition), plus an embedded **`BreadcrumbList`**.
   * Include **`FAQPage`** block (2–5 Q&As) on sizing, materials, lead times, cemetery compliance, editing designs—auto-filled from template.

4. **Unique, non-thin descriptions**

   * Many programmatic pages collapse to the same boilerplate with only a verse changing. Add **2–3 short, unique paragraphs** per item:

     * Para 1: what the motif/verse looks like on stone (contrast, font, placement).
     * Para 2: material guidance (e.g., serif readability on granite vs marble).
     * Para 3: “Design flow” (upload photo, preview, save, request edits).

5. **Internal linking modules**

   * Add **Related designs** (same category + different verse), **Related motifs** (same verse on different product types), and **Guides** (evergreen posts) as static blocks near the middle of the page—not only at footer.
   * Ensure **breadcrumb**: Home › Designs › Traditional Headstone › Biblical Memorial › Amazing Grace

# Template spec (drop-in patterns)

## 1) Title / H1 / Description (fill from fields)

* **Title (≤60 chars):**
  `Amazing Grace (John 3:16) – Traditional Headstone | Forever Shining`
* **H1:**
  `Biblical Memorial: “Amazing Grace” on a Traditional Engraved Headstone`
* **Meta description (145–160 chars):**
  `Design a traditional engraved headstone featuring “Amazing Grace”. Preview online, choose granite, fonts, sizes, and get instant pricing with free design help.`

> Tip: if the verse is *John 3:16*, include the **reference** (`john_3_16`) as a field and render it in both H1 and body—this lifts long-tail matches.

## 2) Canonical & indexing

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://forevershining.org/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial/amazing-grace-john-3-16" />
<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />
```

* Enforce **one** canonical per item. 301 everything else to it.

## 3) JSON-LD (programmatic)

Embed once per page (server-render if possible):

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"Product",
  "name":"Amazing Grace – Traditional Engraved Headstone",
  "description":"Traditional engraved granite headstone featuring the hymn “Amazing Grace”. Design online, choose fonts, sizes and materials with instant pricing.",
  "image":["https://forevershining.org/media/heads/amaz-grace-hero.webp"],
  "brand":{"@type":"Brand","name":"Forever Shining"},
  "category":"Memorial > Headstones > Traditional Engraved > Biblical Memorial",
  "material":"Granite",
  "color":"Black",
  "isConsumableFor": "Cemetery memorialisation",
  "offers":{
    "@type":"Offer",
    "priceCurrency":"AUD",
    "price":"From 1290",
    "availability":"https://schema.org/InStock",
    "url":"https://forevershining.org/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial/amazing-grace-john-3-16"
  },
  "additionalProperty":[
    {"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Verse","value":"Amazing Grace (John 3:16)"},
    {"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Sizes","value":"350–900 mm tablet heights"},
    {"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Finish","value":"Traditional engraved"}
  ]
}
</script>

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement":[
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Designs","item":"https://forevershining.org/designs"},
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Traditional Headstone","item":"https://forevershining.org/designs/traditional-headstone"},
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"Biblical Memorial","item":"https://forevershining.org/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial"},
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"name":"Amazing Grace"}
  ]
}
</script>

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"FAQPage",
  "mainEntity":[
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I edit the verse or add names and dates?",
     "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Use Design-Your-Own to change wording, fonts, and layout. Our team can refine typography and spacing before production."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Which stone and finish works best for readability?",
     "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Deep-cut engraved serif fonts on polished black granite provide the highest contrast and long-term legibility."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Do you comply with cemetery regulations?",
     "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We confirm size, foundation and inscription rules for your cemetery and adjust the design accordingly before manufacture."}}
  ]
}
</script>
```

## 4) Body content blocks (auto-written but unique)

* **Intro (80–120 words)**: mention the verse/motif, product type, material, why the layout/serif choice suits scripture.
* **Design specs list** (generated):

  * Sizes offered (pull from product matrix)
  * Font presets (e.g., *Trajan, Times Engraved, Garamond*)
  * Optional ceramic photo / enamel plate
  * Turnaround & proofing
* **“Why this verse on this stone”** (40–60 words): a micro-explanation to defeat thin content.
* **Compliance note**: one sentence about cemetery approval.

## 5) Images / media

* **Filenames & alt text** are a ranking lever for you.

  * File name: `traditional-headstone-amazing-grace-granite-black-600x600.webp`
  * Alt: `Amazing Grace verse on traditional engraved black granite headstone`
* Provide **3–6 supporting images**: straight-on, 45°, close-up of lettering, optional ceramic photo, size comparison. Each image should have deterministic alt built from fields:
  `alt = "{verse or motif} on {material} {product_type} – {view}"`

## 6) Internal links (static modules in the template)

* **Related Verses** (same category): “The Lord’s Prayer”, “Psalm 23”, “John 14:1–6”
* **Alternate Product Types**: same motif on *Laser-Etched Black Granite Headstone*, *Traditional Engraved Plaque*
* **Helpful Guides** (evergreen): “How to choose fonts for headstones”, “Granite colours & contrast for readability”, “Cemetery rules explained”

## 7) Hreflang (if you localise)

If you plan AU/US/UK mirrors, add `hreflang` pairs across `.org`, `.com.au`, `.com` and ensure each version **self-references** plus references the others. Use the canonical slug everywhere.

# Programmatic generation rules (so this scales)

1. **Slug builder**

   * Inputs: `{motif}`, `{primary_verse_text}`, `{reference}`
   * Steps: lowercase → ascii-fold → remove stopwords → hyphenate → truncate ≤ 60 chars on word boundary → **append reference** if needed for uniqueness.
   * Example: `amazing-grace-john-3-16`

2. **Duplication guard**

   * Before publish, check for existing slug collision; if found, append a short disambiguator: `…-serif-layout` or a short id (not a timestamp).

3. **Asset pipeline**

   * Export all hero/support images to **WebP/AVIF**, ≤ 1600px wide, lazy-load below the fold (`loading="lazy"`, `fetchpriority="high"` only on the hero).

4. **Nav crawlability**

   * Every item page should be discoverable in:

     * XML sitemap (items, categories, paginated lists)
     * Category index pages (alphabetical & filtered)
     * “New Designs” and “Popular Verses” hubs

5. **Page performance**

   * Server-render core HTML (title/H1/meta/schema/breadcrumb) to avoid hydration gaps.
   * Preload hero image (`<link rel="preload" as="image" href="…hero.webp" imagesrcset="…">`) and main font.

# Example: full head block you can render server-side

```html
<title>Amazing Grace (John 3:16) – Traditional Headstone | Forever Shining</title>
<link rel="canonical" href="https://forevershining.org/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial/amazing-grace-john-3-16"/>
<meta name="description" content="Design a traditional engraved headstone featuring “Amazing Grace”. Preview online, choose granite, fonts, sizes, and get instant pricing with free design help.">
<meta property="og:type" content="product">
<meta property="og:title" content="Amazing Grace – Traditional Engraved Headstone">
<meta property="og:description" content="Design a traditional engraved headstone featuring “Amazing Grace”.">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://forevershining.org/designs/traditional-headstone/biblical-memorial/amazing-grace-john-3-16">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://forevershining.org/media/heads/amaz-grace-hero.webp">
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
```

# QA checklist you can automate in CI

* [ ] Canonical equals clean slug; no id/timestamp in canonical
* [ ] Title/H1/Description populated; no defaults like “Untitled”
* [ ] JSON-LD valid: Product + BreadcrumbList (+ optional FAQPage)
* [ ] At least 250 words of unique copy (intro + specs + guidance)
* [ ] 3+ images with descriptive filenames + alt
* [ ] Internal links: ≥2 to related items, ≥1 to a guide
* [ ] Page listed in XML sitemap (items + categories)
* [ ] Noindex on any preview/test urls; indexable on live
* [ ] CLS/LCP budgets met (hero preloaded, fonts subset)

---

# Why this matters (the quick wins)

* **Canonical & slug cleanup** prevents split equity and thin-content penalties across tens of thousands of similar pages.
* **Deterministic metadata** gives you consistent, relevant snippets for long-tail queries like *“amazing grace headstone engraving”*.
* **Schema** improves product discovery, rich snippets, and internal consistency for crawlers.
* **Unique blocks** keep near-duplicate detection from suppressing your long-tail library.
* **Internal hubs** let crawlers and users traverse motifs, verses, and product types—massively improving crawl efficiency and depth.

If you want, I can turn this into a set of Next.js helpers (slug generator, head component, JSON-LD builder, and a test that fails the build when a page breaks any rule).
