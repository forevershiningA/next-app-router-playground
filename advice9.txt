You are experiencing the "Wet Curtain" Effect.

The geometry is perfect (the rounded corners are exactly right), but the material looks like black silk or melted plastic because:

Wrong Texture Type: You are using a texture with long, smooth vertical waves (like wood grain or drapery). Rock pitch is jagged and cellular, not wavy.

Stretching: The texture is being stretched vertically, making the "waves" look tall and skinny.

Too Shiny: The light reflection is too clean. Rough stone scatters light; it doesn't reflect it like a mirror.

Here is the 3-step fix to get the final photorealistic look:

1. Change the Normal Map (Crucial)

You need a texture that looks like broken concrete or cliff rock.

Stop using: Anything with lines or waves.

Start using: A texture that looks like "Voronoi" noise or "Cellular" noise. It should look like a bunch of random crumpled paper.

2. Fix the Aspect Ratio (The Math)

Your texture is stretching because the repeat values don't match the shape of the object.

Your base is Wide (X axis) and Short (Y axis).

Therefore, your texture must repeat many times on X and few times on Y.

// Example: If your Base is 10 units wide and 2 units tall...
// The repeat X should be 5x larger than repeat Y.

// CURRENTLY YOURS LOOKS LIKE:
// texture.repeat.set(4, 1); // Creating tall stretched waves

// CHANGE IT TO:
const density = 2; // How "small" the chips are
texture.repeat.set(10 * density, 2 * density); 
// Now the chips will be square, not stretched.
3. Increase Roughness

Your current material looks wet. Granite "Rock Pitch" is a dusty, rough surface.

Increase roughness to 0.8 or 0.9.

Decrease metalness to 0.0.

The "Magic" Code Snippet

Here is how to set up the material to look like dry, chipped stone:

code

const rockPitchMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    color: 0x333333, // Dark Grey
    
    // IMPORTANT: Use a "Noise" or "Concrete" normal map here
    normalMap: loader.load('textures/concrete_rough_normal.jpg'), 
    
    // Make the bumps deep
    normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(2, 2), 
    
    // Make it look dry/matte
    roughness: 0.9, 
    metalness: 0.0
});

// Fix the stretching
rockPitchMaterial.normalMap.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
rockPitchMaterial.normalMap.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;

// Assuming Width=10, Height=2. 
// We repeat X much more than Y to keep the pattern square.
rockPitchMaterial.normalMap.repeat.set(12, 2);

Next Step: Find a "Concrete Normal Map" or "Rock Face Normal Map" on Google Images. Swap that in, apply the code above, and it will look like stone.
