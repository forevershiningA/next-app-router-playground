This section acts as an interactive demo (or a "configurator preview"). The goal here is to let the user play with the options without committing to the full software yet.

Currently, it looks a bit flat and "wireframe-like." To make it better for funeral products, it needs to feel tangible, precious, and easy.

Here are 4 key improvements to transform this section:

1. Make the "Preview" Real (The Left Side)

The left side currently looks like a flat graphical icon or a placeholder. It doesn't look like a real stone.

The Fix: Replace the flat silhouette with a high-quality, photorealistic render of the stone.

Lighting: Even against a black background, a black granite stone should have "specular highlights" (reflections of light) on the edges to show it is polished and 3D.

The Text: The text "HEART / GLORY BLACK" floating in the middle covers the product. Move this text to a small, subtle label at the bottom right of the image (e.g., Style: Heart | Material: Glory Black). Let the stone speak for itself.

The Inscription: The quote "In our hearts you live forever" looks like a yellow sticker. In the 3D render, make this look engraved (gold lettering carved into the stone). This shows quality.

2. Clarify the Steps (The Right Side)

The navigation on the right is clean, but the logic is slightly off for a user flow.

Step 01 (Icons): The shape icons (square, heart, etc.) are a bit small and grey.

Improvement: Make the selected icon (the Heart) glow with a gold border (which you have), but make the unselected ones slightly brighter so users know they are clickable.

Step 04 Name: Currently, Step 04 is called "Design Your Own." This is confusing because the user has been designing in Steps 1, 2, and 3.

Improvement: Rename Step 04 to "Review & Save" or "Finalize." This implies the end of the process.

Step 03 Name: Rename "Personalize" to "Inscriptions & Art." It’s more specific. People want to know where they add the name and dates.

3. Upgrade the "Next" Button

The "Next" button is sitting alone and looks generic.

The Issue: "Next" implies there is another page of forms.

The Fix: Change the text to "Start Customizing This Design."

The Action: When they click this, it should take them into the full 3D editor with these exact choices (Heart shape, Black granite) already pre-loaded. This reduces friction.

4. Refine the Bottom Stats

The boxes at the bottom ("Shape & Monument Families", etc.) are good for credibility, but the typography is a bit heavy.

Hierarchy: The numbers "40+" and "18 finishes" are the most important part. Make the text descriptions (e.g., "Serpentine, gable...") slightly lighter grey so the numbers pop out more.

"Unlimited": For the "Motif & Inscription Slots," change "Unlimited" to "Limitless Personalization." It sounds more emotional and less like a data plan.

Summary of the "Vibe" Shift

Current: "Select options from a database."

Proposed: "Visualize a real tribute."

Pro Tip: If this is an interactive section, ensure that when the user clicks the "Material" step, the stone on the left instantly changes color (e.g., from Black to Blue Pearl). The immediate visual feedback is what sells the tool.
