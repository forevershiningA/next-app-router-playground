Looking good—the top spray is finally “hugging” the curve. To make it match the reference even tighter and stay robust across shapes, do these 5 small refinements:

1. Nudge margin + smarter band

* Raise only *true* top-band motifs and base the band on the motif’s own height.

```ts
const motifHAuthor = (motifPxH * initH) / overlayH;
const isTopBand = cy < -(initH * 0.18) - (motifHAuthor * 0.15);  // depth adapts to motif size
const marginPx = 14; // was 10 – visually closer to the screenshot
```

2. Smooth the curve profile (removes tiny “jaggies”)
   Right after you compute `topY` in `buildTopProfile`, add a light 5-tap box filter:

```ts
// smooth topY (simple 5-tap box blur)
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) { // two passes
  const b = topY.slice();
  for (let x = 2; x < topY.length - 2; x++) {
    topY[x] = Math.round((b[x-2] + b[x-1] + b[x] + b[x+1] + b[x+2]) / 5);
  }
}
```

3. Clamp horizontal sample inside the stone + side inset
   Prevents over-sampling on the slanted shoulders and keeps birds/leaves off the bevel:

```ts
const sideInsetPx = 12;  // keep a safe inset from left/right edges
const authorX = (screenX - offsetX) * (initW / overlayW);
const col = Math.max(sideInsetPx, Math.min(initW - 1 - sideInsetPx, Math.round(authorX)));
```

4. Cap the upward snap (no overlap with the surname)
   If you detect the top inscription line, keep at least a gap from its bbox:

```ts
const minGapToSurnamePx = 10;
if (isTopBand && surnameBBoxTopAuthor != null) {
  const maxTop = Math.max(topProfile.topY[col] + marginPx, surnameBBoxTopAuthor - minGapToSurnamePx - motifHAuthor);
  const desiredTopAuthor = Math.min(desiredTopAuthor, maxTop);
}
```

(If you don’t have `surnameBBoxTopAuthor` handy, you can skip this; it’s just a safety.)

5. Gentle ease toward the target (prevents micro “jump” while dragging)
   Makes the snap feel natural if the user drags near the curve:

```ts
const snapStrength = 0.85; // 0..1 (higher = stronger snap)
const deltaCyEased = deltaCy * snapStrength;
cyUsed = cy + deltaCyEased;
```

These drop straight into your current `DesignPageClient.tsx` where you already compute `topProfile`, `isTopBand`, and the final `left/top` for motifs. 

If you want me to, I can splice those exact lines into your current motif-mapping block and return the patched file.
