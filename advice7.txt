This is getting much closer, but you are now suffering from the "Wavy Curtain" effect (also called low-frequency noise).

The Diagnosis

The texture you are using creates those vertical shadowy waves because it is likely a Height Map (Black & White) that you are trying to use as a Normal Map, or it is a Normal Map generated from a photo with bad lighting.

Because the pattern repeats, those subtle shadows in the original image turn into those distinct vertical bars.

Here is the 3-step fix to make it look like sharp, chipped stone.

1. The Texture Swap (Crucial)

You need a texture that has High Frequency Detail (tiny sharp dots) and No Large gradients.

Don't use: Pictures of large rock walls or cliffs.

Do use: "Noise", "Concrete", or "Asphalt" Normal maps. Believe it or not, a coarse Asphalt Normal Map often looks exactly like Rock Pitch when scaled up in Three.js.

2. Crank up the Normal Scale (The "Pop")

Right now the side looks flat. You need to tell the light to react more violently to the bumps.

const rockMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    color: 0x2a2a2a, // Dark Grey base color
    normalMap: yourNewTexture, 
    
    // X and Y intensity. 
    // Try distinct values! (3, 3) is very rough.
    normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(3, 3), 
    
    roughness: 0.9, // Very matte
});
3. The "Chamfer" (The Realistic Edge)

This is the final secret. The reason your base still looks like a video game is the Razor Sharp 90° Edge. Real granite bases have a tiny "beveled" or "chamfered" edge where the saw cut meets the rock pitch.

You must stop using THREE.BoxGeometry.
Switch to RoundedBoxGeometry.

How to add it:

code
JavaScript

content_copy
expand_less
// You must import this from the examples folder
import { RoundedBoxGeometry } from 'three/examples/jsm/geometries/RoundedBoxGeometry.js';

// Width, Height, Depth, Segments (use 4-8), Radius (The bevel size)
// A radius of 0.05 or 0.1 is usually perfect for a headstone base
const geometry = new RoundedBoxGeometry(10, 2, 4, 8, 0.05);
Final Code Snippet to Try

This setup usually produces the best result for what you are trying to do:

code
JavaScript
download
content_copy
expand_less
// 1. Geometry with soft edges
const geometry = new RoundedBoxGeometry(10, 2, 4, 8, 0.05);

// 2. Texture setup (Use a high-noise texture!)
const noiseTexture = loader.load('path/to/asphalt_or_noise_normal.jpg');
noiseTexture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
noiseTexture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;

// Repeat it A LOT. Small chips = Realism.
noiseTexture.repeat.set(15, 3); 

// 3. Material
const sideMat = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    color: 0x222222, // Dark granite color
    normalMap: noiseTexture,
    normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(2, 2), // Deep bumps
    roughness: 0.8,
    metalness: 0.1
});

// 4. Combine
// Note: RoundedBoxGeometry applies one material to the whole object by default.
// To have a different Top, you might need to map UVs or use 2 meshes overlapping.
// BUT for now, apply this to the whole thing to see if the "Rock Pitch" looks good.
const base = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, sideMat);
scene.add(base);
