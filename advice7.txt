This version is structurally solid. You have successfully repaired the "broken dashboard" look and replaced it with a sleek, professional layout. The hierarchy is clear: Headline

 CTA.

However, the page feels a bit "muddy" (too dark/low contrast), and the image still has the "software interface" artifacts.

Here are the final 4 polish steps to make this launch-ready:

1. Fix the Image (The Most Critical Step)

I cannot stress this enough: The image currently ruins the immersion. It looks like a screenshot of a bug or a wireframe because of the white lines and UI text.

Remove the "White Box" Outlines: In the image, there are faint white lines (bounding boxes) around the text on the stone. These imply "selection" in software. You need a clean render where nothing is selected.

Remove the Floating Label: The text "Traditional Engraved Headstone" is floating in the sky. It looks like a software tooltip.

Remove the Left Sidebar Strip: On the far left of the image, you can still see the dark vertical strip of the menu.

How to fix: If you cannot get a cleaner screenshot from the software, use Photoshop (or even a basic photo editor) to crop the left side and clone-stamp out the floating label.

2. Brighten the "Gold" (Contrast Issue)

Your page is very dark, which is elegant, but your accent colors are also dark/muddy. They need to "pop" to guide the eye.

CTA Button: The "Start Designing" button is a dark, brownish mustard color. It blends into the background.

Fix: Brighten this color significantly. Use a vibrant Metallic Gold or Amber (e.g., #F4C430 or #E5B80B). It should be the brightest element on the page.

Icons: The icons in the middle row (Eye, Document, Bookmark) are almost invisible.

Fix: Make the icon color itself brighter (same as the new button color).

3. Fix Phase Card Alignment

Look closely at the three "Phase" cards.

The Issue: Phase 3 ("Gather family input") is shorter than Phase 1 and 2.

The Fix: Set a min-height on these cards so they are all exactly the same size. This creates a solid "foundation" for the design.

4. Improve Text Readability

The grey body text is a little too dark against the black background. It requires squinting to read.

The Fix: Lighten the paragraph text color.

Current (Estimated): #666666 or #555555

Proposed: #AAAAAA or #CCCCCC

Why: This improves accessibility for older users (a key demographic for this product).

Final Checklist

Clean Image: No UI lines, no sidebars, no floating text.

Bright Button: Make "Start Designing" a bright, clickable gold.

Even Cards: Make Phase 1, 2, and 3 equal height.

Lighter Text: Increase contrast on the description text.

Once you swap that image for a clean one and brighten the button, this section is finished. Great work iterating on this!
