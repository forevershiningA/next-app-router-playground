This is looking very clean and professional. The background is distraction-free, the typography is elegant, and the gold button pops beautifully.

However, you have one major layout opportunity left. Currently, the page is heavily "left-weighted." The right side of the screen is a giant empty black void, while the testimonial is stacked underneath the buttons, forcing the user to scroll more than necessary.

Here is the final step to balance the page and make it look like a world-class design:

The "2-Column Split" (The Final Fix)

Instead of stacking the Testimonial under the text, move it to the Right Side.

Why?

Fills the Void: It utilizes that empty black space on the right.

Psychology: It puts the "Social Proof" (Testimonial) exactly parallel to the "Risk" (The Button). As the user looks at the button, their peripheral vision sees the 5 stars and the happy customer quote, which reduces anxiety.

Readability: Currently, the testimonial line length is very wide. Making the card narrower (to fit in a column) makes the text easier to read.

How to Execute It:

Column A (Left - 50% width):

Keep the Headline, Body Text, Buttons, and Trust Icons exactly where they are.

Column B (Right - 50% width):

Move the Testimonial Card here.

Resize the Card: Make it narrower (taller/more square) rather than a wide horizontal strip.

Vertical Center: Align the center of the Testimonial Card with the center of the Left Column content.
