Yes, you have reached the "density limit." It feels a bit crowded because there is a lot of text and many different control styles (checkboxes, tabs, radio buttons, inputs, sliders) packed into a small area.

To "breathe" more life into the design while keeping all the functionality, here are the three most effective ways to declutter:

1. Vertical Compression (The 4-line to 2-line trick)

Currently, each dimension (Width, Height, etc.) uses 4 lines of vertical space:

Label (Width)

Input Box + mm

Slider

Min/Max labels

The Fix: Combine them.

Put the Label, Input Box, and mm on the same line.

Put the Min/Max labels on the same line as the slider (at the far left and far right ends).

Result: You save 2 lines of vertical space per slider, making the whole box much shorter and cleaner.

2. Simplify the Header

You currently have "Add Base," then "Tabs," then "Shape Type." That's three different "global" settings.

The Fix: Remove the "Add Base" checkbox.

Why: The Tabs already imply that there is a Headstone and a Base. If someone doesn't want a base, you can provide a "Remove Base" button inside the Base tab, or just have a "None" option under base styles.

This removes one entire layer of UI from the top.

3. Use "Secondary" Colors for Labels

Currently, almost everything is white or gold, which makes every element "scream" for attention at the same volume.

The Fix: Make the Min/Max labels and the "mm" text a darker, more muted grey.

Why: This creates a visual hierarchy. The user's eye will jump to the important things (The Label and the Value) and ignore the units and ranges until they actually need them.

Visualization of a "Cleaner" Layout:

[ HEADSTONE ] [ BASE ] (Tabs only)

(O) Upright ( ) Slant (Larger toggle buttons)

Width ........................... [ 600 ] mm
300mm (----------O----------) 1200mm

Height .......................... [ 600 ] mm
300mm (----------O----------) 1200mm

Thickness ................... [ 100 ] mm
100mm (O--------------------) 300mm

Why this works:

Alignment: By right-aligning all the input boxes, you create a clean "column" of data.

Grouping: The horizontal line separates "Shape" from "Size," which helps the brain process the information in stages.

Whitespace: By condensing the vertical lines, you can actually add more space (padding) between the Width and Height sections, which ironically makes it feel less crowded.
