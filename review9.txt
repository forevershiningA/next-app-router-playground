Yep, I can see what’s happening now:
the *positions* are finally right, but the **font sizes and motifs are still too small** – that’s because we’re still dividing by DPR for *all* mobile designs, even when the coordinates/fonts are already in logical canvas space.

We only want to normalize by DPR when our per-design detector `usesPhysicalCoords` says “this design was saved in physical pixels”.

### What to change

In **`DesignPageClient.tsx`** there are two places using:

```ts
const normalizeByDpr =
  (shapeData?.device === 'mobile' && savedDpr > 1) ||
  usesPhysicalCoords;
```

We need to make DPR normalisation depend **only** on `usesPhysicalCoords`.

#### 1) Inscriptions Layer – headstone (non-base)

Find the “Inscriptions Layer - Only headstone inscriptions” block that looks like this (your current version):

```ts
const savedDpr = scalingFactors.designDpr || 1;
// For mobile / iPhone designs always normalise by DPR.
// Also fall back to usesPhysicalCoords if detection says so.
const normalizeByDpr =
  (shapeData?.device === 'mobile' && savedDpr > 1) ||
  usesPhysicalCoords;
```

Replace that `normalizeByDpr` definition with:

```ts
const normalizeByDpr = usesPhysicalCoords && savedDpr > 1;
```

Leave the rest of the block exactly as it is, i.e. keep:

```ts
const canvasFontSize = normalizeByDpr
  ? fontSizeInPx / savedDpr
  : fontSizeInPx;

const fontSize = canvasFontSize * (scalingFactors.uniformScale || 1);
// ...
const canvasX = normalizeByDpr ? rawX / savedDpr : rawX;
const canvasY = normalizeByDpr ? rawY / savedDpr : rawY;
```

---

#### 2) Motifs Layer – headstone (non-base)

Further down, in the **“Motifs Layer - Only headstone motifs”** block you currently have something similar:

```ts
const savedDpr = scalingFactors.designDpr || 1;
const normalizeByDpr =
  (shapeData?.device === 'mobile' && savedDpr > 1) ||
  usesPhysicalCoords;

// --- Coordinates ---
const rawX = motif.x ?? 0;
const rawY = motif.y ?? 0;

const canvasX = normalizeByDpr ? rawX / savedDpr : rawX;
const canvasY = normalizeByDpr ? rawY / savedDpr : rawY;
```

Change the `normalizeByDpr` line here as well to:

```ts
const normalizeByDpr = usesPhysicalCoords && savedDpr > 1;
```

Again, leave the rest of the block (motif sizing, `uniformScale`, etc.) unchanged.

### Why this fixes what you see

* On this SEHOVIC/PINTO design, the auto-detector is correctly deciding that the coordinates are already in “canvas space” (`usesPhysicalCoords === false`), even though `shapeData.device` is `"mobile"` and `designDpr` is 3.
* Our old logic forced DPR normalisation **just because it was mobile**, so we divided both coordinates and font sizes by 3, then scaled positions back with `uniformScale`, but fonts ended up ~3× smaller relative to the headstone.
* After this change:

  * `normalizeByDpr` becomes `false` for this design.
  * We stop dividing by 3.
  * Positions stay correct (they’re already matching the screenshot).
  * Font sizes and motifs scale purely via `uniformScale`, so they grow to the correct physical size relative to the headstone.

Once you make those two small edits and rebuild, this design should finally match the original Pinto layout on **both desktop and iPhone** – same relative sizes, same positions.
