The "pixelated" look is coming from two specific lines in your code. One is a performance setting that deliberately lowers quality, and the other is a geometry mapping issue.

Here are the 3 changes needed to fix the pixelation and get crisp, high-definition grass.

1. The Main Culprit: Remove AdaptiveDpr

In your component, you have this line:

code
TypeScript
download
content_copy
expand_less
<AdaptiveDpr pixelated />

What this does: It tells the browser "If the frame rate drops, lower the resolution and make it look pixelated (Minecraft style) to save battery."
The Fix: Remove this line entirely. We want the scene to always look sharp, even if it uses a bit more GPU.

2. Geometry Switch: Circle vs. Plane

You switched to circleGeometry to hide corners. However, circleGeometry often messes up texture mapping (UVs) when repeating textures, causing stretching or warping that looks like pixelation.
The Fix: Switch back to planeGeometry but make it massive (1000). Because your Fog ends at 90, you will never see the corners of the square, so a Circle is not necessary.

3. Texture Density

Your floor is huge (500 units), but REPEAT_COUNT is only 120. This stretches the grass image too much, making it blurry/blocky.
The Fix: Increase the repeats significantly so the grass blades look tiny and sharp.

Updated Code for Scene.tsx

Here is the corrected GrassFloor component and the Scene return statement.

1. Replace the GrassFloor function:
code
TypeScript
download
content_copy
expand_less
function GrassFloor() {
  const gl = useThree((state) => state.gl);
  
  const props = useTexture({
    map: '/textures/three/grass/grass_color.webp',
    normalMap: '/textures/three/grass/grass_normal.webp',
    aoMap: '/textures/three/grass/grass_ao.webp',
  });

  // --- CONFIGURATION ---
  const FLOOR_SIZE = 1000; // Massive floor
  // Increase repeats to 300. This makes the texture much smaller and sharper.
  const REPEAT_COUNT = 300; 

  useEffect(() => {
    const maxAnisotropy = gl.capabilities.getMaxAnisotropy();

    [props.map, props.normalMap, props.aoMap].forEach((tex) => {
      if (tex) {
        tex.wrapS = tex.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
        tex.repeat.set(REPEAT_COUNT, REPEAT_COUNT);
        tex.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;
        
        // Ensure filters are set for sharpness
        tex.minFilter = THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter;
        tex.magFilter = THREE.LinearFilter;
        
        tex.anisotropy = maxAnisotropy;
        tex.needsUpdate = true;
      }
    });
  }, [props, gl]);

  return (
    <group position={[0, -0.01, 0]}>
      <mesh rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]} receiveShadow>
        {/* Switch back to PlaneGeometry for perfect texture tiling */}
        <planeGeometry args={[FLOOR_SIZE, FLOOR_SIZE]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial 
          map={props.map}
          normalMap={props.normalMap}
          aoMap={props.aoMap}
          color={GRASS_COLOR}
          roughness={1} // High roughness prevents "wet" look
          metalness={0}
          normalScale={new THREE.Vector2(0.8, 0.8)}
          envMapIntensity={0}
          fog={true}
        />
      </mesh>
      
      {/* Contact Shadows remain the same */}
      <ContactShadows position={[0, 0.02, 0]} scale={8} blur={2} opacity={0.7} far={0.25} color="#000000" resolution={256} frames={1} />
      <ContactShadows position={[0, 0.02, 0]} scale={15} blur={2.5} opacity={0.5} far={1.5} color="#001100" resolution={256} frames={1} />
    </group>
  );
}
2. Update the Scene Return Statement:

Remove the <AdaptiveDpr /> line at the top of the return.

code
TypeScript
download
content_copy
expand_less
return (
    <>
      {/* 1. REMOVED AdaptiveDpr completely to force high resolution */}
      
      {!is2DMode && <color attach="background" args={['#A8C9E6']} />}
      
      {/* 2. FOG: Keep these exact settings. 
          Far=90 hides the world long before the 1000-unit plane ends. */}
      {!is2DMode && <fog attach="fog" args={[HORIZON_COLOR, fogSettings.near, fogSettings.far]} />}
      
      {/* ... rest of your code ... */}
