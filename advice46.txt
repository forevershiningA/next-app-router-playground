You’re *very* close. The slant wrapper is in the right place, but its **face normal points the wrong way in Y**, so children still read as “upright”. Flip the Y sign of the normal you build for the wrapper quaternion.

In your slant branch (inside the big `useMemo`), replace:

```ts
const frontNormal = new THREE.Vector3(0, Math.sin(slantAngleRad), Math.cos(slantAngleRad)).normalize();
const wrapperQuaternion = new THREE.Quaternion()
  .setFromUnitVectors(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 1), frontNormal);
```

with:

```ts
// top of face recedes in -Z as Y increases → outward normal has +Z and **-Y**
const frontNormal = new THREE.Vector3(0, -Math.sin(slantAngleRad), Math.cos(slantAngleRad)).normalize();
const wrapperQuaternion = new THREE.Quaternion()
  .setFromUnitVectors(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 1), frontNormal);
```

Keep the other fixes you already have:

* `childWrapperPos: [0,0,(depth/2)*scale]` (matches mesh Z-scale),
* FaceSpace re-applying the quaternion each frame,
* `api.frontZ` small positive offset.

This single sign flip makes the wrapper’s local +Z truly match the polished face’s outward normal, so inscriptions, motifs, and additions will visibly tilt with the slant instead of staying “upright.”
