That “frozen” look is just **IBL reflections from the HDRI** hitting your polished base at a grazing angle.

* In your scene you still mount `<Environment preset="forest" background={false} />` with the **default intensity = 1.0**, so the base’s horizontal faces are reflecting a bright, cool-skied HDRI. From the side it reads like ice/water. 
* Your sky/fog colors are already neutral; they’re not the culprit here. 

### Quick fixes

1. **Lower global IBL** (do this first)

```tsx
<Environment
  preset="forest"
  intensity={0.2}      // 0.15–0.35 is a good range
  background={false}
  rotation={[0, Math.PI / 2, 0]}   // optional: rotate to move bright lobes
/>
```



2. **Dial down reflections on the base only** (inside your base material in `HeadstoneAssembly`)

```tsx
// Base material suggestions
<meshStandardMaterial
  roughness={0.75}      // ↑ roughness to blur reflections
  metalness={0.0}       // granite is dielectric
  envMapIntensity={0.15}
/>
```

(Keep the headstone face a bit shinier if you like, but the base wants softer reflections to avoid the “ice slab” look.)

3. If you still see cool patches, **rotate** the environment a bit more until the bright sky lobe isn’t mirrored on the base top:

```tsx
<Environment ... rotation={[0, Math.PI, 0]} />
```



Optional: if the granite textures look a touch cold after this, you can nudge your key/fill lights a hair warmer (they’re already warm/neutral) or slightly increase the base albedo warmth in its texture tint.

After lowering IBL and softening the base’s reflectivity, that side view will stop reading as “frozen” while your granite still looks convincingly polished.
