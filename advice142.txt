This looks clean, professional, and very high-end. The dark theme with the gold accents fits the "Memorial" brand perfectly.

I have just two small "polish" suggestions to make this section 100% perfect, and then we should move to the "Design Possibilities" section to keep the momentum going.

1. Polish: Make the "Glass" Effect Visible

In the screenshot, the cards look a bit like solid dark grey boxes because the background behind them is mostly pitch black. Glassmorphism needs something behind it to blur.

Fix: Increase the opacity of the background glow blob slightly.

Change: Find the bg-[#cfac6c]/5 div and change it to bg-[#cfac6c]/10 or even /15. This will put a subtle golden haze behind the cards, making their semi-transparency obvious.

2. Polish: Make the Button "Shiny"

The button currently looks like a flat matte gold. To make it feel like polished metal, we can boost the gradient contrast and add a tiny "glint" on top.

Change: Add border-t border-white/40 to the button classes. This adds a highlight on the top edge that makes it look 3D.

Next Step: "Design Possibilities" Section

For the next section (Design Possibilities), we should avoid using simple icons again, or the page will look repetitive.

I propose a "Bento Grid" Layout. instead of icons, we use Textures and Images:

Premium Materials: Show a circle of actual Black Granite texture.

Shapes: Show a silhouette of a Serpentine headstone.

Motifs: Show a real image of a gold rose engraving.
