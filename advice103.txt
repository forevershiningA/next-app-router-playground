Yep—good eye. It’s not your warm key/fill/rim lights; the blue wash is coming from the **sky/IBL** that the ground “sees” at grazing angles in the front view.

* Your sky dome has a deep blue zenith (`uColorTop: '#005c97'`). When the camera is low and looking past the stone, the grass normals face the horizon/sky and pick up that cool tint via image-based lighting, so the ground goes bluish. 
* In the high, far view you sent, the camera mostly sees **near ground** lit by your warm spot/point lights, so the grass looks neutral/green. The direct lights in `Scene.tsx` are all white/warm, so they’re not the blue source. 

Quick ways to prove/fix it (any one helps):

1. Temporarily remove or comment out `<AtmosphericSky />` — the blue cast will vanish. If you want to keep the effect, make the zenith less blue (e.g., `uColorTop: '#5f8f9a'` or a muted teal). 
2. Nudge lighting warmer on the ground: add a subtle `hemisphereLight` with a slightly warm sky and neutral ground, or raise your warm key/overhead intensity a touch so direct light outweighs the cool sky. 
3. If you later re-enable reflections on the grass, keep `envMapIntensity` very low so the sky doesn’t dominate at glancing angles. (You already set it to `0` on the grass material.) 

So: it “looks fine” from the back because nearby, warmly lit ground dominates; the front view exposes more sky-tinted indirect light.
